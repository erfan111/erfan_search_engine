Subject: NBA JAM FAQ for Genesis

              Welcome to Sega NBA JAM FAQ! v1.1
 
Disclaimer: This is an early version of the FAQ.  All codes and information
have been tested and are believed to be accurate, but don't blame me for any
inconsistencies or mistakes.
 
Introduction:
      This FAQ is intended to provide information on the game NBA JAM for the
sega genesis.  Keep in mind, that much of the players, strategies, codes, and
information provided are intended to be used only on the sega version, and that
this FAQ does not neccessary help people understand or play the Super Nintendo,
Game Gear, Arcade, or Tournament versions of this game.  The following sections
are included in this FAQ:
 
I. Secret Codes and Powerups(I put this first because many people will be most
interested in this information, and won't want to read the rest of this FAQ)
 
II. Game Strategy
 
III. List of Players and their strengths
 
IV. List of Speech
 
V. Credits
 
Additionally sections may be added to later versions of this FAQ if found
neccessary...
 
Version History:
 
1.0 First version.
 
1.1 Corrections, Moon, and G Clinton, and minor additions...
 
New Versions of this FAQ will be posted Monday mornings on weeks that enough
new information has come in to warrant an updated FAQ.
 
I. Secret Codes and Powerups.
 
  A. Powerups.
 
    NOTE:All of the following powerups are entered at the tonight matchup
    screen.  This is the screen that shows immediately after teams for the
    game are chosen.
 
    1. Powerup Defense-Press A, B, or C 5 times, and hold down on the 5th time.
       If entered correctly, it will say so above your players Turbo meter.
       This powerup will increase your ability to goaltend without getting
       called for it, and to steal the ball easier.
 
    2. Powerup Dunks-Press the directional pad 360 degrees and press A,B, or C
       13 times. If entered correctly, it will say so above your players Turbo
       meter.  You will gain the ability to perform a dunk from anywhere past
       half court.  However, if you are using a player with the minimum dunk
       skill, this powerup will fail.
 
    3. Powerup Fire-Press A, B, or C 7 times and then hold up+B+C until the
       tip off.  If entered correctly, it will say so above your players Turbo
       meter.  You will stay on fire for the duration of the game.
 
    4. Powerup Intercept-Press the directional pad or joystick 360 degrees, and
       then press A, B, or C 15 or more times.  If entered correctly, it will
       confirm that you have entered this code abover your players Turbo meter.
       The easiest way of getting this code is to simply tap a button as much
       as you can after you do the full circle on the directional pad or stick.
       The game doesn't care if you tap more than 15 times. This gives you a
       better chance of intercepting the passes of opponents, but it really is
       not particualarly noticable during the game of an average player.
 
    5. Powerup Turbo-Press the A, B, or C button 5 times, and then press and
       hold the A, B, and C buttons all down.  This powerup will be confirmed
       in the same manner as the above 4 powerups.  If done properly, your
       player will have an unlimited supply of turbo.
 
    6. Juice Mode-If you defeat all 27 teams you will automatically activate
       this mode which quickens the speed of all players. Also, you can get
       juice mode if you press A, B, or C 13 times, and then hold down B+C.
 
    7. Shot Percentage-Press A, B, or C once, and then hold A, B, and down
       on the directional pad(three things held down at once), until the
       tip off. This will show a small box(where the timer usually is) which
       will tell you the percent chance that a given shot will go in.  Note
       that the NBA JAM kit that circulated to those who ordered the game
       before it came out included a poster that said that pressing down was
       not neccessary, but this does not work.
 
  B. Secret Characters
 
     NOTE:NBA JAM includes the use of certain characters that are not part of
     the NBA. Playing with these characters will give you statistics that
     are different than the teams for which they play on. For example, if
     Bill Clinton is used, and he replaces Dominique Wilkens(who has full
     dunking ability), you will find that Bill doesn't have quite as the
     same range of dunks that Dominique has even though it says(at the screen
     that shows players ratings---the team select screen) that he has full
     dunking ability. I will post secret player ratings when they're known.
     For the following characters, enter the first two letters of
     their initials at the initial screen, then move to the third letter, and
     then hold down the start button, and press the indicated button.
 
    1. Bill Clinton, president of the United States. Initials:ARK Button A
 
    2. Al Gore, vice-president of The United States. Initials:NET Button B
 
    3. Mark Turmell, Arcade head programmer. Initials:MJT Button A
 
    4. Rivett, Arcade programmer. Initials:RJR Button B
 
    5. DiVita, Arcade programmer. Initials:SAL Button C
 
    6. Chow Chow, Home programmer?. Initials:CAR Button C
 
    7. Weasel, Home programmer? Initials:SAX Button C
 
    8. Scruff, Home programmer? Initials:ROD Button B
 
    9. Air Dog, Home programmer? Initials:AIR Button A
 
    10. Kabuki, Home programmer? Initials:QB_ Button A
 
    11. P Funk aka George Clinton, Rapper, Initials:DIS Button C
 
    12. Warren Moon, Houston Oilers Quarterback, Initials:UW_ Button A
 
    NOTE: The following 4 more sets of initials produce effects. If you play
    1 game with them, you will have their record from the high scores list,
    but all that will be saved to the list of saved names is a record of 0 and
    0. Anyone understand the purpose of these?
 
    11. ? Initials: GAP Button C
    12. ? Initials: JAZ Button B
    13. ? Initials: SNK Button C
    14. ? Initials: ZOB Button B
 
   3. Other Assorted Things.
 
     It's unlikely that the arcade code for big heads has been included in
     the sega version, but if anyone knows otherwise, please send it to me,
     and I will include it in the FAQ. Video Games magazine printed a poster
     that supposedly showed all the characters from the original arcade
     version, and the home versions.  Besides the already discovered secret
     characters, there were 2 others shown. These were: Flea and
     another long haired guy who probably was a programmer.
     I hope everyone is looking for other strange stuff in
     this game...we've found alot already, but it would be disappointing if
     we've found everything except for a few hidden characters.
 
II. Game Strategy
 
  There is no need for me to list the basic moves of the game since they are
  all outlined in the instruction manual that comes with the game.  I'm just
  going to list a few things that work well(I may add more later).
 
  The key to winning at NBA JAM is getting on fire.  If you can't make 3
  baskets in a row in order to get on fire, you just aren't going to be able
  to win as easily, as when you do.  In this version of NBA JAM, the best way
  to get on fire seems to be to get your defense to stop the other team from
  scoring.  Getting the opponent to shoot 3 point shots is good because they
  are not very difficult to block if you do a "super block"(turbo and block).
  Of course it helps to be a player who isn't really short...like Skiles or KJ.
  Once on fire, take 3's until you notice that you can't make any. When that
  happens, the computer is cheating, and it's time to take inside shots. Use
  the shot percentage cheat to get an idea of the best places to shoot for the
  individual player that you use. If you are used to the arcade, you may
  expect to push down opponents who are dunking.  This is much harder in the
  sega version.  Usually blocking is more effective, unless you are very close
  to the dunking man. Guard the key to avoid dealing with dunks and layups.
  Do dunks and layups to heat up.  Don't try lot's of 3 pointers with really
  bad 3 point shooters. Most of what I've been saying is probably obvious to
  veteran players, and not helpful to novices.  I'll try to improve this
  section in the future.
