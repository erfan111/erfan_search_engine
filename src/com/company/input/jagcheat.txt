JAGUAR GENERAL TRICKS (JAG)
---------------------
Stupid JagCube Tricks:

As soon as the spinning cube appears, press and hold Pause, then:
     Up     Zoom in
     Down   Zoom out
     Left   Accelerate left
     Right  Accelerate right
     0      Reverse rotation
Release Pause to continue the boot sequence.  Press Reset (*#) or any
action button to go straight to the game.

Remove "PAUSED" Message:
     Press 1+3 when paused.  Doesn't work with all games.


ALIEN VS PREDATOR (AVP)
-----------------
Both cheats entered anytime during gameplay.  Cheat II is a superset
of Cheat I.

Cheat I ("Hold that Fuji!") Enable:
     Hold Pause+Option.
     Hold 1+3, then release.
     Hold 2+5+7+9.
     Predator laugh confirms.

Cheat I Commands:
     Raise Security Level  Option+6
     Lower Security Level  Option+9
     Toggle Motion Tracker Option+8
     Toggle Weapon Access  Option+1...4
     Reload All Ammo       Option+1+2+3+4 (simultaneous)


Cheat II ("Banana Stops") Enable:
     Hold Pause+Option+6+1+3, then release.
     Type B,A,9,A,9,A ("BANANA")
     Type *,Option,6  ("STOPS")
     Type #,*         ("POST")
     Type *,Option    ("STOP")
     Type 2,Option    ("TOP")
     Predator laugh confirms.

Cheat II Commands:

     Up Level              Option+A
     Down Level            Option+B

Note: After entering the Cheat II code, using the Toggle Cheat command
will give you unlimited life and ammo (the ammo bars will run down, then
refresh themselves; the energy bar will run down to zero and stop).  To
get unlimited ammo, you must already have some ammo in the weapon.  The
Up/Down Level commands cycle through each sublevel, both alien ships, and
all the air vents.

Freeze Alien Queen:
     Anywhere inside the Queen's lair, save your game, then reload.
Awaken Queen by walking through the lair entrance.  Note that the Queen
can be damaged while frozen, but won't actually die until you "unfreeze"
her.

     Enable All Levels and Weapons         3,7,6,6,8,2,4,2

     Hold A+C while turning.

     When damaged to the point that your warning light is flashing, hit
yourself with a Cruise Missile.


KASUMI NINJA (KAS)
------------
Both Players Play As Same Character:
     At Options screen, select Change Code (a lockout code must already
be entered).  Hold A+C on controller #2, then type 6,2,1,5,4,4 on
controller #1.  "Ha!" confirms.


RAIDEN (RAI)
------
Infinite Lives and Bombs:
     At first boss, hold 1+4+7+3+6+9+Option.  "Extra ship" sound
confirms.  Works for both players.


TEMPEST 2000 (T2K)
------------
Enable Cheats:
     At the main menu, hold 1+4+7+A.  "Excellent" confirms.  The
following cheats are enabled during gameplay:
     Skip to Next Level     : Option
     Enable Warp Bonus Round: 6

Enable Rotary Controller:
     At the Game Option menu, hold Pause on both controllers.
"Excellent" confirms.

Pause Bug:
     At end of the Bacon/Jupiter River bonus round, press Pause just as
it switches back to the main game (after approximately two and a half
pulses of the "Excellent!" graphic).
     The graphics in the game will now be slightly glitched.   The
starfield won't scroll, messages won't disappear, the SuperZapper might
not work, and the web won't be solid-filled.  Entering the "Green Path"
bonus round effectively ends your game.  Exiting the Jupiter River or LSD
bonus rounds will occasionally mess up the double-buffering of the main
game (though it corrects itself after you die or finish the level).

Invisible Web:
     Start any Tempest Plus game.  Hold down Option (cheats must be
active) until you get to the rainbow levels.  The web will be invisible
during the rainbow levels only.
