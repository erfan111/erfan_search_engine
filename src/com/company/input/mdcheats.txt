MegaDrive secrets removed from the Genesis Secrets List v4.
January 19, 1992

The following are MegaDrive secrets that have been booted off of the 
Genesis Secrets list.  Could someone please let me know if the Gynoug 
tricks work on Wings of Wor and if the Magical... tricks work on Decap 
Attack?  Thanks.

GYNOUG
( Infinite Credits ) Every time the Game Over message appears, hold 
down A, C, and LEFT.
( Easy Mode ) Go to the Option Screen, and move the cursor onto "game 
level".  Now hold down A, B, C, and press Start.

( Stage Select ) To access a special Stage Select menu, first go to 
the main options menu.  Move the cursor to Control.  Now press and 
hold the A button for about ten seconds.  A Stage Select screen should 
appear.


MAGICAL FLYING HAT TURBO SIMULATOR
( Extra Lives) On level 1 and 3 (and others), are red flagpoles which 
sway if you jump on them.  Jump, then float straight down to the 
yellow tip.  The pole bends in the middle, one of the red spots in the 
pole turns white, and you get an extra life.  Get loads of lives.

Genesis List Rejections
January 19, 1992

All of these "secrets" (or parts of them) have been found to be not so 
secret after all.  Read the guidelines for submission at the beginning 
of the Genesis Games Secrets List v4 to find out exactly why.

If you see anything here that you feel, according to my guidelines, 
should *not* have been removed, let me know.  I haven't played most of 
these games, so maybe some of these tricks have some value that I 
missed.

Someone suggested that this could used as the start of a strategy 
guide.  I don't have the time or inclination to run it, however.  If 
anyone wants to do it, they're certainly welcome.  Lists of passwords, 
locations of warp zones and 1-UPs, and all of the other things I've 
rejected as non-secrets would probably be welcomed by a lot of people 
as strategies, hints, and cheats.  I, for example, have the list of 
all the Populous worlds, and, while it would be way out of place in 
the secrets list, it would be right at home in a strategies list.

In short, if you want to run a Genesis strategies list, grab this and 
post your intentions.

[This hint was very gabby and included some general strategies, so I 
trimmed it down a lot.]
AFTERBURNER II
( Extra Missles ) Before you reach the refueling plane, you have to 
push a direction on the control pad and B.  The direction on the 
control pad varies with which stage you are in.  For levels 3, 13, and 
16, push Left and B.  For levels 5, 11, and 21, push Right and B.  For 
levels 9 and 19, just push B.  You have to push thes down before 
reaching the refueling plane.  The process is instantaneous, so you 
don't have to keep your finger down on the waiting for the words to 
appear, telling you that you did the method correctly (If you pushed 
thes and nothing appears instantly, you did something wrong).  As for 
text, it seems they're trying to make a story out of it (You are Tom, 
but on a mission to rescue to fair princess Mia from the evil 
Simekiri). There IS an end to this game, but don't be fooled by the 
text, thinking that it is leading to an ultimate boss man.


[This "secret" is one of those anyone can figure out.]
BATMAN
( Extra Batarangs ) In Flugelheim, there is a long passageway up 
complete with spike laden moving platforms.  Go to the top, move to 
the left, grab the batarangs, move right and jump down to last 
platform, let the platform move all the way down and then up, jump up 
and left and grab replenished batarangs. You can max out your "rangs" 
this way.


[This "secret" is one of those anyone can figure out.]
BATMAN
( Extra Lives ) Also, on level 3 at the far right end of the first 
level of the museum is an extra life.  Grab it and jump onto the 
rising platform.  When the screen starts to scroll up, jump back down.  
The extra life is there again!  Get up to the 9-life limit.


[As far as I can tell, unless passwords work differently in this game 
than they do in other games, this is something you can find out on 
your own.  Regardless, it is just a cheat and not what I'm looking 
for.]
DEVIL'S CRUSH
(Passwords) THEDEVILSI gives you 145,000,000 points and 70 balls.  
ONECRUSHME is 594,000,000 points and 27 balls. THECRUSHL gives you 
999,999,900 points and lets you see the end of the game.


[This is another simple cheat, basically a glitch in the game.  If you 
look for these, you can usually find them, and it's not the type of 
thing I'm looking for.  Most real secrets were intentionally put into 
the game, although perhaps accidently LEFT in the game...]
FAERY TALE ADVENTURE
( Unlimited Items )  Save a game before opening a chest.  Open the 
chest.  Save the game and restore it.  The chest is closed again.  
Open, save, and restore as many times as you want.


[Again, I've never played this game, but I assume a player would 
naturally jump into the chest at some point and would probably check 
for the 1-UP again.  The "restored-1-UP" feature occurs in so many 
games that most experienced players check for it at this point.]
FANTASIA
( Extra Lives )  In World 1-2, there is a platform with a note that 
gives you a 1UP.  Get it and head right till you reach a treasure 
chest.  Jump into it and you'll be at the start of the level and the 
note is back.  Repeat.


[Another restored 1-UP trick.  Maybe I'll add an appendix to the 
Genesis list describing how to discover these "secrets" for yourself.]
FANTASIA
( Max Out Lives and Magic ) You can max out your lives in the water 
stage.  First fight your way to the second stage to the point where 
there are platforms that go up.  Once you get there you have to jump 
up the platforms to the top and you'll get a 1-up.  Next fight your 
way through the level until you get to the point where you're right 
before the magic book.  Take the magic book and keep moving to the 
right until you see a treasure chest.  Go into the chest and you'll 
come out just past the platforms.  Go to the left and jump back up the 
platforms.  Do this trick as many times as you want.


[This is the MegaDrive version of Wings of Wor.  Apparently both of 
these work in Wings of Wor.  If someone could confirm or deny this I 
would appreciate it.]
GYNOUG
( Infinite Credits ) Every time the Game Over message appears, hold 
down A, C, and LEFT.
( Easy Mode ) Go to the Option Screen, and move the cursor onto "game 
level".  Now hold down A, B, C, and press Start.

( Stage Select ) To access a special Stage Select menu, first go to 
the main options menu.  Move the cursor to Control.  Now press and 
hold the A button for about ten seconds.  A Stage Select screen should 
appear.


[I do not want passwords to levels that you can get to normally.  If 
the password takes you to some special level (see Tommy Lasorda 
Baseball), then I'll put it in the list.]
HERZOG ZWEI
( Last Level ) The password for the final level is JLJOIGLAOKN.


[Some games, like Sonic, are full of fun things for you to find, 
secret passages, and things like that.  While I haven't played James 
Pond, from reading this "secret" that seems to be the case with this 
game.  These are only secrets in the sense that they are hidden things 
you are meant to find through normal gameplay, and thus inappropriate 
for the Genesis Secrets list.]
JAMES POND
( Warp Zones) There are four warp zones for James Pond.  Remember that 
you must snag all of the items in each level to enter the warp zone.  
Mission 1: There are two warp zones in Mission 1.  To enter either you 
must first free all of the Lobsters.  Once you've freed them move to 
your far left between the wall and your home pipe and push Down in the 
middle of the ground.  This warps you to Mission 6.  The other warp 
zone is also to the far left.  You'll notice a little ledge just out 
of the water.  Stand on top of it and push Down to warp to Mission 11.  
Mission 2: Once you grab all of the items in Mission 2, return to the 
tube that leads to your house.  On the left side of the tube in the 
middle of the ground push Down to warp to Mission 5.  Mission 4: Go to 
the dark water area surrounding the Ship.  Look for a long ledge to 
your left.  Go to the middle of the ledge and push Down to warp to 
Mission 8.


[The following the a MegaDrive game which Decap Attack is based on.]
MAGICAL FLYING HAT TURBO SIMULATOR
( Extra Lives) On level 1 and 3 (and others), are red flagpoles which 
sway if you jump on them.  Jump, then float straight down to the 
yellow tip.  The pole bends in the middle, one of the red spots in the 
pole turns white, and you get an extra life.  Get loads of lives.


[Yet another list of passwords.]
POPULOUS
( Passwords )
	CALEOLD         100     
	EOAMPMET        200
	BILQAZOUT       300
	BADMEILL        400
	WEAVUSPERT      494 (final world)
	KILLUSPAL       999 (secret level) (Ed. note:  I had to use the 
full name to get to this level (it claims to be 179))


[The Magical Replenishing 1-UP Trick, Part 183]
REVENGE OF SHINOBI
( Extra Lives ) In round 4-2, there is a hidden 2-Up. At the beginning 
of the round, walk to the edge of the pit and jump straight up, 
flipping and firing a spread of stars before coming down. This will 
expose a 1-Up on the ledge across from the pit. Jump over to the other 
side of the ledge when the 1-Up is exposed (it will still be half 
hidden behind the ledge) and then walk off the ledge to the left, 
grabbing the Power-Up before falling off the Screen. Although you will 
lose one man in the process, two men will be added to your reserves. 
Repeat this process to get as many lives as possible.


[More level codes you can collect yourself through diligent gameplay]
SAINT SWORD
( Level Codes ) Level 3-1: IQW1EL, Level 4-2: KWWKQQ, Level 6-1: 
S2YY2Y, Level 6-2: S0GZAL, Level 4-1 2nd Quest: K2J0CK, Level 5-2 2nd 
Quest: QW10C2, Level 7-2 2nd Quest: XXKSIS


[If this is something special, I might put it back.  Let me know.]
WARRIOR OF ROME
( See Ending ) At the title screen, select the password option and use 
the code: GREBDQ3QNE
