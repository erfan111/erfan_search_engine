                             WARNING

"X" is the first of a new generation of robots which contain an innovative 
new feature  --  the ability to think,  feel and make their own decisions.  
However this  ability could  be very dangerous.   If "X" were to break the 
first rule of robotics.   "A robot must  never  harm a human being."   The 
results would be disastrous and I fear that no force on earth could stop.

Approximately  30 years  will be required before we can safely confirm his
reliability.   Unfortunately  I will  not live to see that day.   Nor do I 
have anyone to  carry on my work.   Therefore,  I have decided to seal him 
in  this  capsule,   which  will  test  his  internal  systems  until  his
reliability  has been confirmed.   Please do not disturb the capsule until 
that time.

"X" possesses great risks as well as great possibilities.  I can only hope
