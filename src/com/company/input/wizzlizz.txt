   0. Brief Disclaimer.

     This FAQ is Public Domain, and can be freely distributed.I
made this FAQ for the benefit of those who love to play video
games, I don't care if anyone copies this, or whatever. I would
appreciate it if my name was kept in it somewhere. Thanks.
Plus, if someone plays Wizz 'n Lizz till there EYES pop out because
of this FAQ, sorry, not my fault..... :>

   1. Brief History.

     The game Wizz 'n Lizz, is fairly simple to play. The game
revolves around a basic simple plot. Save all the rabbits on the
level before the time runs out. The twist is that at each level,
you get 2 pieces of fruit. In the first world there is 8 levels, in
the second world, 16 and 32 on the third (plus a forth world).
There is also 14 different kinds of fruit. When you mix any two
pieces of fruit, a certain spell/cheat/hint/points/stars/etc will
appear. There are 196 combinations of fruit. This FAQ will mostly
cover ALL combinations of fruit, and all the benefits, as well as
a couple other cheats/hints I learned on the way.

  3.a Hints About Mixing Fruit.

     1. When you Mix an Apple + Banana, You open the Store. This is
the most important Hint/CHeat in the game. It allowed you to sell
your fruit before it goes bad, and buy other fruits. The prices for
the fruit are (all prices are in STARS):
     Apple 30 -- Strawberry  30 -- Banana 30 -- Orange 30
     Carrot 30 -- Potato 40 -- Cabbage 40 -- Mango - 40
     Lemon 60 -- Onion 60 -- Pear 60 -- CHerry 100
     Avocado 120 -- Mushroom 140.

  These are the price to buy, the store buys back fruit at 1/2 the
price. Plus also at the store you can buy 5 SECONDS for 15 stars,
or a LIFE for 300 stars. Or take a chance with the ? for 60.
     If you are FEELING poor, hold -START- and -C- when the BUY
option is highlighted, and all FRUIT will be sold at HALF PRICE!!!.


     2. Some Fruit Combinations Actually Give more Stars then they
Cost. ie Lemon + Mushroom Gives 300 stars, but only costs 200
stars. Its easy to build up a ton a stars each turn this way. Note,
you are only allowed to buy a certain amount of each fruit (or
TIME) per turn. I marked the these examples with a '**'

     3. On every *EXIT* that leads to some sort of MINI-GAME (ie
Rabbit Invaders..etc) will give you the opportunity to get some
free stuff (some games points/stars/time/lives/fruit/etc). This is
a neat thing for those people obsessed with finding hidden games.
Or people like me, who still tell tales about those good 'old
gaming days......(I loved Space Invaders).

     4. When you mix the fruits that Skip Levels (ie Mango+Onion),
it will re-open the level, if you have already been there.

     5. If you COLLECT a MAGIC Diamond/Ruby/Emerald/Sapphire a
*EXIT* will open allowing you to play the bonus level of ANY LEVEL
at ANY world, with no risk (even if you don't save all the
rabbits). I am curious if this does anything else. Its a PAIN in
the ass to collect all the JEWELS. I guess I was expecting more. :)

     6. A Banana + Potato will open the HINT-SHOP. This SHOP will
sell hints for STARS. NOTE: If you have this FAQ, then you already
know all the hints. (Besides, some of the hints are totally
obvious, you get better hints by trying lots of different
passwords. Certain passwords will tell you various
cheats/hints/jokes). Though, its a REALLY BIG pain in the ass to
randomly enter in passwords.

     7. If you get to the point were you have lots of useless
fruit, and/or little money, take a chance with APPLE + ORANGE, it
will randomly change all the fruit, usually into something more
valuable (if you are on a lower difficulty).

     8. In the 'Splat the Dude game', STRAWBERRY + ORANGE, if you
really splat the crap out of the dudes, you will get a free life.

_________________________________________________________________
     ---3.b General Hints---

     1. Fruit will disappear after 3 levels, unless you use the
fruit saving spell.

     2. When playing a bonus level, if you don't save all the
Rabbits, the game will take your stars away, and all your time.
Make sure you save all the rabbits!

     3. The -A- Button will make you drop through floors/levels.
This might seem obvious, but I didn't know about it.

     4. Don't buy to much time, 3 minutes in the limit.


     5. Wabbits with funky colors (Gween, Bloo, Wed) are much more
valuable.


     6. If you hang around in the color of MAGIC *EXIT*, STRAWBERRY
+ LEMON, you will get 250,000 POINTS! (after 10 minutes though).

     7. If you collect everything in the bonus level, you will get
an extra life.

     7b. If you at least save all the Rabbits in the bonus level,
you will get 50,000 points.

     7c. When the screen says 'Push Start Button' at the beginning
on the second stage, of any land, HOLD down A+C, then start, and it
will GIVE you all the BONUS letters, automatically making the
player go to the bonus level at the end of the round. This only
works, providing that the player does not loose a life during the
game.

     8. Don't forget that in levels higher then Apprentice (except
SUPER WIZARD), you have exploding wabbits. Here a couple exploding
wabbit hints:

      A.  Make sure you always save a 'dying' wabbit,
          else you will loose all your bonus letters.
      B.  Your fairy will always show the quickest route
          to a dying wabbit.
      C.  Before you have the magic word, a dying wabbit
          will always release a magic letter. (I am not
          sure about this, but this is one of the hints
          in the HINT_SHOP).

     9. If the CLOCK ever runs down to 10 seconds while you play.
You will get a chance for more time. Within that 10 seconds, one of
the wabbits that you save will release a 30 SECOND BUBBLE. If you
catch this, you will get the 30 seconds. NOTE: Its possible to get
more than one bubble in a game. (For example, its possible to win
the game, without collecting a TIME, or loosing a life, if you just
keep finding those bubbles).

     10. During the game, if you hold the joystick UP, and press A,
a 30 SECOND BUBBLE will appear from one of the wabbits, even though
you may have plenty of time left (You will hear a "YAHH!!!" if it
works. This doesn't always work, and sometimes the 30 second
bubbles are very hard to find. I would only use this if you -KNOW-
you will definitely finish a level before the 10-second level,
whereas, the UP+A is a risk-free way of getting 30 seconds.






_________________________________________________________________
     ---4. CHeats

     1.  If you press the START button, while pressing the last
letter of any LEGAL code, you will start the game with 100 stars,
and with the Fruit Store already there!!   For example:
The CODE-> HHBT PSSR (pressing 'R' with start), will start you out
on Apprentice with 100 starts and Fruit Store Open. I learned this
when I mixed the LEMON + CHERRY, then it TOLD ME!


     2. Holding A+B+C, during the SEGA logo, and press start TWICE,
you will be able to start on the SUPER WIZARD LEVEL. (go into the
option, and change the difficulty level). Or, use the password HSSN
RLLL to go straight to the SUPER WIZARD LEVEL, with shop and 100
starts.

     3. The password TCDT GBBS will make a MENU pop up, showing all
the BOSS's in the game, for you to fight, individually.

     4. THe password MGTP GLLS starts the game at the last round of
the last level. (have fun!).

     ---5. Plans for v-1.4

     1. I will probably add the codes for all the levels.
     2. I will probably find a couple more secrets to add.
     3. I will probably include some sort of game strategy section.
     4. I will probably provide a better description of the GAME.
     5. I will probably provide a list of GAME GENIE codes.
     5b-I will probobly have to buy a GAME GENIE to do #5. :)
     6. I will probobly include a two-player section.
     6b-I will probobly not be able to do #6 since all my friends
        REALLY hate this game.
     7. I will probably mention the Designer, CHUDLEY, and all
     the great amiga games he did in the past (ie Killing Game
     Show).

     If you want to say, HEH, What a fine job on this FAQ, E-MAIL!
     If you want to give me lots of money....Western Union....
