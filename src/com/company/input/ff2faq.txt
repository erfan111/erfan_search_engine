I)     Characters(player controlled):

            Cecil:
               Occupation: Dark Knight --> Paladin
                    The main character in the story, and
                    ultimately the strongest member of your
                    party. He can use almost any weapon, but works
                    well with a sword.He can be equipped with
                    almost any armor, and can cast a few low level
                    white magic spells after he becomes a paladin.
            Kain:
               Occupation: Dragoon
                    Kain is mostly here for a plot twist. He is
                    Cecil's best friend, and begins the game by
                    your side. He can be equipped with any sword
                    or spear(except crystal) and can use almost
                    any armor.
            Rydia:
               Occupation: Wh. Wiz./Bl. Wiz./Caller -->Bl. Wiz/Caller
                    Rydia is a caller from the town of mist. She
                    falls unconscious after Mist is destroyed
                    by the package.  Cecil protects her and she
                    joins him in battle. At first, she can cast
                    both black, white, and caller magic but after
                    she visits Leviatan, she can use only black
                    and caller magic, which have been dramatically
                    increased She can use only a bow and arrow,
                    the rod, or a whip.  As for armor, Rydia can
                    only use robes.
            Rosa:
               Occupation: Wh. Wiz.
                    Rosa is Cecil's girlfriend from Baron. Cecil
                    finds her in Kaipo after an earthquake, and
                    must find the Sandruby to help her. After
                    that, she joins Cecil's party. She is
                    a user of white magic, and, like Rydia, can
                    use Bows and arrows(and should). She can also
                    use the various staffs.  For defense, Rosa relies
                    on robes, and no shield.
            Tellah:
               Occupation: Sage(Wh. Wiz./Bl.Wiz)
                    Tellah is a sage from Mysidia, who joins you
                    on the way to Damcyan. At first, he can only
                    use low level black and white magic, but after
                    Mt. Ordeals, he becomes very powerful, although
                    his mp remains low. He can use the staff or rod
                    in battle, and can defend himself with
                    weak armors and robes.
            Edward:
               Occupation: Bard
                    Edward is the Prince of Damcyan. After losing
                    his girlfriend in an attack by the Red Wings,
                    Edward chooses to help Cecil. He attacks by
                    using one of the two harps, and defends with
                    low level armor or robes.

            Cid:
               Occupation: Engineer
                    Cid's special talent is PEEP.He can tell you
                    how many hit points a monster has and what its
                    weaknesses are.  He can use a bow and arrows,
                    but he works better when using a hammer.He
                    can use most armors.
            Edge:
               Occupation: Ninja
                    Edge is the prince of Elban, which was
                    destroyed recently. You find him in the
                    Elban cave, where he gets beaten by Rubicant.
                    He can use the very powerful ninja swords and some
                    armors.  He can also cast strong magic spells.
                    As an added bonus, he can throw almost every
                    item as a weapon and steal items from enemies.
                    This makes him the most versatile character
                    in the game.
            Yang:
               Occupation: Karate Man
                    You find Yang on the way to Fabul. After
                    assisting him, he joins you. He can attack
                    using the claws, and he can use some armors.
                    His special move attacks all enemies on
                    the screen. It is good when fighting low level
                    monsters, but for stronger monsters just have
                    him attack normally.
            Fu Soya:
               Occupation: Lunar(Bl. Wiz./Wh. Wiz)
                    He is a very powerful wizard from the moon. He
                    will join you as soon as you find him in the
                    crystal palace.  He can use some armor and the
                    staffs/rods, but his real strength is that he
                    can cast just about all black AND white magic
                    spells.
            Porom:
               Occupation: Bl.Wiz.
                    One of the twins of Mysidia, Porom can cast
                    low level Black magic. When paired with his
                    sister, they can cast the twin spell, which
                    should be the strongest magic you have at the
                    time.Equip him with a rod.
            Palom:
               Occupation: Wh.Wiz.
                    The other twin from Mysidia. She can cast
                    low level white magic. She should be equipped
                    with a staff.

V) Sneak Items
 The following is a list of enemies and items that you will get from enemies if 
you use Edge's Sneak command on them. Be warned! This list does not contain 
every enemy, as some enemies (like those native to the Tower of Zot) you will 
not have a chance to sneak. I have found it nigh-impossible to sneak some 
enemies. (like Breath and Mind) To my knowledge, bosses cannot be sneaked. Most 
enemies will give you mundane items, like Cure1 and Heal potions.

VII)			Questions.........and answers

-How do I defeat...

        Octomamm:Use Rydia's call magic(chocobo) and Tellah's
                lit spell along with Cecil's powerful attacks
                to defeat him. Not very difficult to beat.

        Antlion:Since the antlion responds to hand attacks by
                taking off alot of damage, use magic and Rydia's
                chocobo to win here. Have Cecil attack (if you
                think you can spare the hp's) but you really only
                need him here to administer cure potions.

        Milon(1):Have Cecil attack Milon directly, as he cannot
                harm the undead monsters. Let Tellah use his fire
                spells and make the twins cast TWIN until the
                battle is over. If you need to refill energy,
                use Tellah or potions, as MP are hard to
                come by this early in the game. Immediately after
                defeating Milon, save your game at the nearby save spot.

        Milon(2):Right before the end of the bridge, use change to
                reverse the rows of your party This will save you
                time during the fight and let you get an extra
                attack in. Milon will use poison against you, so
                have Tellah use heal potions or the heal staff,
                if you have one. Have the twins TWIN, and make
                Cecil attack.

        Baigan: The middle section of Baigan will cast WALL on
                itself immediately after the battle begins, so
                if you use magic, use it on the arms. Have Cecil
                attack the body and have Yang use his special attack.

        Kainazzo:Immediately have your wizards(Tellah/Palom) cast
                their strongest Lit spells. Use Porom to heal
                your party after Kainazzo floods you. Have Cecil
                and Yang attack as normal.

        Dark Elf:When you first fight the Dark Elf, you must
                intentionally lose the fight. If you have ALOT
                of hp, attack yourself, or else it will take
                forever. After he beats you, Edward will use the
                Twin harp to revive you. You will have full hp and mp,
                but it wouldnt hurt here to save the game in the
                room right outside.Just attack the Dk. Elf as any
                other enemy; his only attack is a combo of ice,
                lit, and fir(all level 2), which isn't even that
                strong. When you defeat him you will be rewarded
                with the Crystal of Earth.

        Magus Sisters:The main strategy here is to attack the
                heaviest one first(middle). Do not use magic
                unless the sister casts wall a second time and
                it reflects onto one of your characters.
                If this happens, have Tellah cast his strongest
                spell (ONLY ONCE) on the member of your party with
                the wall. You have a one in three chance of hitting
                the middle sister.  Once she is defeated, the
                Delta attack cannot work and you should lose no
                more hp, making it easy to defeat the other
                two sisters.

        Valvalis:Have Kain constantly using his jump attack
                to stop her spin. have Cecil attack, and have
                Cid attack also.  Use Rosa to heal you, unless
                you brought an extra set of bow and arrows along. 
		Another good idea here is to carry some
                armor Rosa can use with you into the Tower of Zot,
                and Equip her with it before you fight Valvalis.
                Otherwise she is not well protected.

        Calbrena:Two strategies here: First, you can go all out
                and try to kill all six dolls before they merge.
                This is a great idea if you are powerful enough.
                Otherwise, you can just wait it out and heal
                yourself until they form CalBrena. After that,
                just attack as you would any other foe.

        Balnab/Dr. Lugae:Once you defeat these two, Lugae
                transforms himself and you must defeat him again.
                He's not that tough. Just use your head and heal
                when you have to.

        EvilWall:Have Rydia use Virus(or Levia, if you have it
                already).At any rate, just make her do her most
                powerful magic.  Edge should use the stars that
                you have picked up along the way so far. When
                those are gone, Bersk him. Rosa should Bersk Cecil
                right away, so he can get in more attacks. Have
                Kain jump every time. If one of your characters
                gets crushed, bring him back to life, but
                only use life1. Dont waste your mp filling him/her
                back up. Do that after the battle, because once
                the Wall starts crushing, it doesn't matter how many
                hp's you have, because you're dead.

        The King and Queen of Elban: The inportant thing here is
                to keep people alive. If you can last until the
                King and Queen come to their senses, you are all
                set. You dont even have to attack, as they will come
                to their senses regardless of if you attack or not.
                You can fight them if you want to.Dont be afraid
                to use up you MPs, because Rubicant heals you
                completely before you fight him. A good idea here
                is to go back down to the save room, just
                in case you think you can't defeat Rubicant.

        Rubicant:Its very difficult to time, but most of the time
                it works well. Have Rydia cast her Shiva or Ice3
                spell, but try to time it so she casts it as
                Rubicant opens his cape. Otherwise, Ice and cold
                spells heal him. Bersk Cecil(you should do this
                with every boss) If more than one of your
                characters are swoon, then have Edge cast Flame.
                Rubicant will revive all dead members of your party.
                Have Rosa attack, then cure, then attack, etc.

        Queen Asura:Rosa must be at level 34 or everyone else must
                be at level 99. Have Rosa cast the wall spell
                on Asura, and all her cures will reflect onto
                your players. She rarely attacks, so you dont
                have to even worry about curing yourself. Just
                attack her until she dies. She can't refill
                her energy.

        King Leviatan:Just attack him, and Cure yourself after he
                waves you. As always, besrk Cecil and this
                time Edge, as well.

        King Bahamut:As soon as you get FuSoYa, go to Bahamut's
                cave on the moon. You can do it without him, but
                it is MUCH MORE DIFFICULT, as you only have one person
                who can cast Wall. Use Rosa and FusSoYa to cast
                wall on as many members of your party as you can
                before Meganuke comes. Use your judgement here...
                decide for yourself which charcters you need to                
		stay alive. If you can get them all, great. But
                chances are, your wizards aren't at a high enough
                level to cast wall spells quickly. Have the wizard(s)
                cast Wall on themselves, so in case anyone else dies,
                they can stay alive to cast wall again.

        CPU:This is a snap if you got the bahamut spell before
                returning to Earth. Attack the healing globe
                first, then the attacker, then concentrate on
                the big one. You are likely to fall victim to
                GLOBE99, which instantly kills your character.
                Just have Rydia do BAHAMUT constantly, and have
                FuSoYa cast his strongest spell.
	   -Alt. strategy: Go after the Defender first, then the 
		attacker, then the CPU. This way, you will be taking damage
		from the attacker, which is considerably less than the CPU.
					-From The "Zotmeister"	
								
									
        Zeromus:First, use the crystal(CECIL MUST USE IT). Once
                he has transformed, Bersk Cecil. Have Rydia use
                Bahamut or Nuke.Have Rosa attack with White, unless
                you need to be cured. Zeromus will use Virus, Meteo,
                Big Bang, and the Black Hole. Big Bang takes off
                a couple thousand hps and then drains them for a
                while. The Black Hole makes all magics invalid.
                This means that if you casted a wall spell, it
                disappears. (I think that is the correct effect.
                It does nothing to deter any attack or heal magics.
                If anyone can verify this, E-mail me. Thanx) Zeromus
                has approximately 105,000 hit points.


-How do I get the Pan?
        Once you have gone through the Sylvan cave and found
        yang sleeping, go to the overworld and talk to Yang's
        wife. She will give you the Pan.Then return to Yang and
        use it on him.  Then you will recieve the call magic
        Sylph. If you return to see Yang's wife after that, she
        will give you the spoon dagger, which can only be thrown
        by Edge. There is only one in the game, so save it for
        Zeromus. It takes 9999 damage.

-How do I reach the four treasure chests below the town
 of Summoned Monsters?
        To reach the chests, go to the first floor of the town.
        In the lower right area there isa hidden spot you must
        walk on. It looks like a normal peice of the floor, except
        it is outlined in brown. Step there and you will go to the
        room with the four chests. A note of caution: If you want
        to stay in the town after opening the chests, walk back to
        the tile you came in on. The other tile in the room warps
        you back outside.

-Where is the Pink Tail?
        On the moon, go to the Lunar Subteraen, Level 5. Walk all
        the way to the right, and there is a room with a chest on
        the right side. It is the only thing in the room, and there
        is a cabin inside the chest.  Walk around the room for a
        while, and eventually you should bump into a Pink Puff.
        Defeat it and it may give you a Tail. BTW, the chances of
        finding a pink puff are 1 in 64, and the chances of him
        giving you a tail are also 1 in 64. You do the math. If
        you've got the time to kill, by all means, try it.



VIII)                       Tips from Adam and Kelly:
                          

        -Don't "drain" undead monsters.

        -Dont use the lillith rod on a lillith.

	 -For some easy experience, try this: In areas where you fight
         Alert or Summoners, let them keep calling monsters. The Alert won't
         call anything until you attack it, so use a low level spell, such as
         VENOM, which takes off very few hp(so the fight lasts longer).
	 Defeat the summoned enemies repeatedly and rack up the experience!	


        -If you know that you will "lose" a character
        (he will leave your party) then de-EQUIP him
        before he leaves so that you may keep the
        weapons and armor, and sell them. On a similar
        note, if you know that a person will join your party
        in a location far from a town, i.e. Rosa in the Tower of
        Zot, buy the armor and weapons for that character in
        advance, if you can afford it.

        -Immediately upon entering the Sylvan or Summoned
        monster caves, cast the float spell on all your
        characters. All characters can be effected
        at the same time-you dont have to cast the spell five
        times.You do, however have to do it each time
        you go up or down a floor.

        -On the Big Whale, there are two control switches.
        One is the crystal in the center of the room, as
        you enter the ship. That will take you from planet to
        planet.The other switch is directly above the crystal,
        on the wall. This will let you fly the ship around
        on the planet you are on. When you get FusoYa, you
        can do the latter and fly over to Bahamut's cave,
        and get his call magic. It will help you defeat the
        Elements and the CPU inside the Giant of Bab-Il. If you
        don't, it doesnt matter; you can always come back later.

        -Its probably common knowledge, but were you aware
        that on the Big Whale, if you walk down, you can
        see another room (two, actually). In the first of
        these two rooms, there are a bucnh of rectangle shapes.If
        you step on one of these, it refills all your life
        and mp. In the second room, there is a big Chocobo
        to store all your items.
