(Adapted From Tapfaq v.3.0)
 
3 Good Reasons to play as KYOSHIRO SENRYO
--> Lots of moves make for fun play
--> Good range for long weapon
--> His ego is bigger than most can count
PLUS:
--> Near complete air superiority
--> Can do many special moves WITHOUT weapons
--> *** HE'S THE ONLY ONE TO GET THE GIRL ***
 
3 Bad Things about KYOSHIRO SENRYO (and why they are wrong)
--> Weak attacks in air, usually loses to a well-timed counter
	- Um, no. This is a lie.
--> Only character that got ONE new move
	- He was perfect when created ;p
--> Won't give autographs
	- He will if he likes you.
 
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
KYOSHIRO INFORMATION:
 
   HISTORICAL INFO ON KYOSHIRO:
   (Adapted From Character History Faq v.2.0)
 
SENRYO KYOSHIRO--Getting info on this guy was a real pain, mainly
because almost all English books on Japan focus on economics, politics,
and so forth and very little on popular culture. No wonder academics
are considered out of touch...
	Kyoshiro is based on a fictional character named
Nemuri Kyoshiro. "Sleepy-Eyed Kyoshiro, Notes on Villany," by
Renzaburo Shibata was a novel serialized in a post-war magazine and
later made into a TV series. Kyoshiro was a skilled swordsman, but was
also an eccentric outcast and a womanizer. I found nothing that said he
was an actor but the information I have on him is limited...
Note that Kyoshiro is in the Kabuki costume of a lion, which is why
he has such long red hair. Also note that fans are an essential part of
Kabuki theater, and used in dances and such.
 
   INFO ON KYOSHIRO FROM THE ORIGINAL SS:
   (From SSfaq v.12.0: Probably Taken There From The Home Version Manual)
 
  Name:        Kyoshiro Senryo
  Title:       The Kabuki Master
  Origin:      Tokyo, Japan
  Alma Mater:  Kabuki Kollege of Dramatics and Stage Chewing, Edo Campus
  Weapon:      Shishi Ha [Lion's Blade] (naginata)
  Misc. Info:  In Japanese literature, Kyoshiro was an actor and a
               swordsman, though in the game, Kyoshiro uses a naginata,
               not a sword. Also, his father is Nao Itsu Oba.
 
   INFO ON KYOSHIRO FOR SS2:
   (Taken From The Tapfaq v.3.0: Taken From The Home Version Manual)
 
The Kabuki Master     
        KYOSHIRO SENRYO
 
"I will have your spirit," said the crazed Kabuki student before 
Kyoshiro  
resorted to the unspeakable and poked out his eye.  A promising student,
Kyoshiro searches for the demon who possessed the lad.  This master of
Kabuki movements is a formidable adversary and lies in wait for demons who
seek to destroy the clan of Kabuki.  "If you can take my soul, try it.  But
remember, I'm not getting small.  It is the theatre that is!"
 
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
ENDMATCH MESSAGES:
(From Tapfaq v.3.0: More Exist)
 
"My Kabuki spirits'll beat the evil king!"
"What a deplorable 'Kabuki'!  Commit 'Harakiri'!"
"Go through the real beauty of 'Kabuki' by your death!"
"You can't behave like me, even if you imitate my costume!"
"Fight like dance, and win.  That's the soul of Kabuki!"
 
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
MISC. INFO:
 
--> If anyone successfully performs their POW super move, the audience in 
his background claps.
--> When choosing to play Kyoshiro, A selects the Red Kyoshiro, and D 
selects the Blue (and inferior-looking) Kyoshiro.
 
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
GENERAL STRATEGY:
 
Here are some of the most basic points about how to use Kyoshiro as an 
effective player:
 
1) AIR ATTACKS: The air is where Kyoshiro is at his best. He has superior 
range in the air, the AB jump, and the Dance of the Demon (see SPECIAL 
MOVES) are devastating attacks. Remember, damage is still doubled in the 
air, and Kyoshiro can beat nearly everyone in the air without exception. 
9 fights out of 10 can be won by waiting for the opponent to jump in on 
you and then tagging them, especially against the computer. Its that 
simple. Whether you are jumping back with them or jumping into them from 
the other side, Kyoshiro runs the show in the air.
	The thing I will talk about is the 'K' point. This is the place, 
a little more than a body length away from your opponent, that you can 
stand and be at the exact extent of Kyoshiro's range, and thus be out of 
the range of most everyone else. If you stay there, you will run the game 
no matter what. When you are there and you opponent jumps towards you, 
jump back and AB him. You will hit, he will not. Its a beautiful thing.
	If you are not at that point, and/or you are both jumping toward 
each other, some people can beat you. When jumping INTO an opponent, it 
is better to use the Dance of the Demon, which will hit more. If not, 
Gen-an's mid-air uppercut, Caffine's pole slash and hat move, Jubei's low 
jumping slash, and many of Ukyo's moves will catch your AB in the air if 
you are not placed perfectly. As opposed to waiting to do the AB attack 
after they are starting theirs, you want to do an A as soon as possible, 
and you can still beat them in the air, but only if you attack first. 
Ukyo is a particular problem with his Firebirds, but you can adjust to it 
with experience. See SPECIAL ATTACKs section about how to sucker someone 
in the air.
 
2) GROUND ATTACKS: Kyoshiro isn't shabby at all on the ground either. He 
has superior air defence with his back-AB and kabuki flame. In close, his 
As and Cs have very high priority, and can quickly back off anyone too 
close. You generally want to keep your distance from opponents because 
you have reach, so use it. If they do come in too close, you can use your 
pole throw to get them away (see SPECIAL MOVES section). If you stay at 
the 'K' point, you can nail most people on the ground who are preparing 
special moves, including Hanzo and Galford. While most of the time you 
want to be in the air countering special attacks, it is possible to do 
this as well on the ground. The only person who can beat his reach is 
Ukyo. Strategies to go after him are useful in all cases. If they throw a 
special at you, duck it, roll forward in, and start wailing away with the 
A or C, and set them up for an AB stunner. 
	Kyoshiro's duck and dash tactics are similar to everyone else's, 
except that he has less distance to go because of his reach. Remember to 
use it to your advantage. Dash or roll in only to the point where you can 
hit them and they can't hit you. Dashing in and using a variety of 
Kyoshiro's special attacks is a great tactic. If you dash in and use the 
same special (Flying Lion's Tail, Dance of Fire) at the same intensity 
(CD or AB), your opponent will eventually catch on and nail you. Dash in 
a couple of times using a C Lion's Tail, to the point where the opponent 
is ready to counter your dashes by blocking and jumping you. Next time 
in, do an AB Dance of Fire and fry him as he jumps (See SPECIAL MOVES 
section for more). Or dash in and throw them away on the pole. Use your 
judgement. The point is to mix it up. Kyoshiro's got the depth to do 
this. You should stay airborne, but you can pull off a ground offensive 
if you need to change the pace against humans.
 
3) UNARMED FIGHTING: Kyoshiro is one of the best unarmed fighters in the 
game because he can still use many of his powers without his weapon, 
unlike characters like Ukyo and Charlotte who are useless without their 
weapons. You can go either one of two ways. You can stall by throwing 
fans and kabuki flames to keep opponents away until the weapon returns, 
or you can go on the offensive. Unarmed, you get priorities on most 
attacks, so you can get away with some pretty nasty Bs and ABs. In close, 
kicking is the best. The low CD combo is especially good if you are 
trying to drive someone back, and C them to death in a corner, or follow 
up with a kabuki flame. Remember that you can only use C, D, and CD 
throws when you are unarmed. Catching the opponents weapon can do some 
devastating damage, too, but is a trick to get right. Well worth the 
practice though.
 
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
NON-ATTACK MOVEMENTS:
 
Dash forward -> Joystick forward twice
Dash back -> Joystick back twice
Fake back -> Joystick back once, forward once
Roll forward -> Joystick down diagonal front twice
Roll back -> Joystick down diagonal back twice
Duck -> Down twice (dodges specials)
Hop forward -> Forward BC
Hop back -> Backward BC
Catch opponent's weapon (unarmed) -> Forward half-circle
 
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

KYOSHIRO'S TAUNTS:
 
AC - Kyoshiro makes move like going for flaming fan and pulls out a 
regular fan, which he unfurls.
BD - Kyoshiro stands up and takes out a long pipe, lights up, and smokes it.
 
No change with or without weapon.
 
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
THE SPECIAL ATTACKS AND WHAT TO DO WITH THEM:
(All Special Attack Patterns Taken From The Tapfaq v.3.0)
(! Denotes weapon needed for move)
(* Denotes does damage against blocking character)
 
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Flying Lion's Tail              | Drives weapon into ground to use as 
(Chobi Jishi)                   | leverage, and twirls, emitting blasts of
 |   / O- + Kick                | fire to hit for fire damage.
 O O                         *! |
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
 
	This on has several useful applications, and is a very good move. 
In the first step of the move, it brings Kyoshiro back out of reach of 
enemy attack, then drives the opponent back and out of range with the 
attack itself. In addition to all that, it does blocking damage. Be 
careful using it on an opponent too close to the corner, however (See 
last section on this move). 
	Remember that you can use it as a C, D, or CD attack, getting 
progressively slower and higher in damage. If someone is jumping in on 
you, you can catch him with a C one before he hits the ground or gets an 
attack in. You need EXTREMELY good timing for this to work, however. 
	If someone is dazed, go at him with a CD. If he is preparing a 
complex super move, jump in with a D or CD. Dashing in with a C one is 
good, and can drive your opponent back into the corner as well. Mix up 
the special moves you use with the in-dash for added effectiveness.
	WEAKNESSES: If you have someone in the corner, or are using a CD 
attack, be very cautious with this move. It is very counterable if you do 
no not knock them back far enough. This move is also VERY susceptible to 
long range low attack counters (Nak's ground slide, etc etc), which 
cannot be blocked in time if you do not hit with this move, so use 
caution. This move CAN be jumped over and is susceptible to attacks from 
above, so be aware and don't use a CD when a C is appropriate.
 
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Swirling Dance of the Demon     | Twirls into the air, holding weapon along
(Kaiten Kyokubu)                | shoulders to attack for weapon damage.
 -O | \   + Slash               | 
    O   O                    *! |
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
 
	This one is (guess what?) primarily an air attack. You get 
multiple hits with it as well (see COMBOS), so it is a potentially 
powerful move. If you know you have someone caught jumping, pulling this 
one results in mega-damage. Better for jumping INTO someone, as opposed 
to away.
	Another use is fighting your way out of corner safely. If you use 
an A one while you are trapped in a corner, one of several things will 
happen: a) You will clear you opponent and be out of the corner b) You 
will hit you opponent with the move, while driving him back. c) He will 
block, taking blocking damage as he is driven back. Get the picture?
	WEAKNESSES: Apparently this move can be countered by some kicks. 
It is also possible that he can be slashed out of this move by an 
opponent in the air.
 
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Dance of Fire                   | Exhales a huge, spiraling flame into the
(Kaenkyokubu)                   | air to strike for fire damage.
 | \   -O + Slash               |
 O   O                        * |
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
 
	This one is also a multi-task power. You can use it to catch 
someone jumping in or to consume an enemy's projectile. A quick A one can 
counter some relatively fast air attacks.
 	If you've knocked someone down, run up to him and do a B or AB. 
He will either block it and take blocking damage, or swallow full damage. 
Ditto someone stuck in a corner.
	WEAKNESSES: This does NOT counter ninja's portals. The A and B 
Dance of Fire does NOT protect against certain low attacks, like Nak's 
ground slide.
	
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Blood Mist Slice     (jumping)  | Performs the Kabuki Crunch Dance in the
(Chi kemuri kuruwa)             | middle of a jump.
 while jumping, |  + AB         |
                O           * ! |
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
 
	This is a great bluff out power. Eventually, whoever your 
opponent is will assume that you jumping means an AB attack. Wait for 
them to start an air defense for it and then spin away. It is also useful 
as the first move in a combo (See COMBOS).
	Another use that has proven effective is jumping straight up when 
in close and performing the Blood Mist Slice on the way down. Most 
anti-air attacks will be overcome by the range of the Blood Mist Slice, 
and it will, at the least, drive your opponent back for blocking damage.
	This CAN knock Cham Cham out of the Face Scratcher if done right. 
	WEAKNESSES: There are several ways this can be countered by your 
opponent. If it is blocked, you will be lagged for a second. Quick, low 
attacks can also catch you when you land. Also characters with superior 
reach (Kyoshiro, Ukyo, etc) can catch you with an anti-air attack. 
Long-reach kicks may also be able to knock you out of it.
 
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Kabuki Swirl                    | Throws a flaming kabuki fan at opponent to
(Fuuretsusen)                   | hit for fire damage.
 |   / O- + Slash               |
 O O                            |
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
 
	The most basic projectile attack. You can use it to negate an 
enemy projectile or harass, but these are the most strategically basic 
uses for the fan.
	Throw one at an opponent to sucker him into jumping and follow 
the fan in with a jumping AB. Enemy keeping doing jumping in place 
attacks? Catch him on the way down with a fan. Dozens of fun uses. 
Remember, use A when want speed, AB when you want power.
	WEAKNESSES: There is a significant lag when you go into your 
shirt for the fan, so don't use it when you are too close unless you have 
REALLY good timing.
 
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Spear Throw                     | Grabs opponent and tosses with spear for
 when close, -O + B or AB     ! | damage.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Hair Toss                       | Grabs opponent with hair and tosses for
 when close, -O + D             | damage.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Hair Strangle                   | Grabs opponent, and wraps hair around
 when close, -O + CD            | neck, strangling for multiple hits of 
                                | damage.
                                |
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
 
	The only strategical differences with these throws is that the 
spear throw gets the opponent farther away from you after completion. In 
trouble and need to get the guy way? Use the spear throw. Got him on the 
ropes and want him in close to finish him off (or got no weapon)? Use one 
of the C and D throws.
 
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Super Deformed Transformation
 
 -O O-   / | \   -O O- + D
       O   O   O
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
 
	Everyone knows about these darlings. The only thing it does is 
make you look cute and makes you immune from throws. You can get surprise 
on your side by coming out of it with a special move. If you are way on 
the other side of the screen from your opponent, you could SDT and catch 
him with a fan on the way in, but it is so difficult to pull off, it is 
strategically a bad idea unless you REALLY want to embarrass a neoephite.
 
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
POWER SPECIAL: Aragotoshi Kyoshiro "Chiniku-no mai"                   
(Flesh Flail Dance of Kyoshiro) | Spins across floor, creating large flames
 -O O-  / | \  -O + C           | that burrow into opponent, hitting for 
      O   O   O             * ! | fire and breaking damage.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
 
	The best time to zap someone with this is, ideally, when they are 
stunned, but there are other ways. One is getting them right after you 
have knocked them down, or if they are jumping in. An enemy without a 
weapon against Kyoshiro's reach is dead meat quickly. Remember you can 
move while you do this. If someone jumps at you, swirl back or forward 
and catch them on the way down.
	This can also be used a temporary defense if you are at full POW. 
When you begin the move (forward-back with no buttons pressed and full 
POW) you are invulnerable for a second or two to all attacks. I have 
gotten skilled at this enough to be able to pull off the second of 
invulnerability fairly regularly and use it as a defense, especially 
close in. 
	WEAKNESSES: Be careful of players who block this or players with 
long reach if you do not start the move right next to them. You will get 
countered in the first case and attacked coming in on the second case.
	That second of invulnerability can also come back to haunt you. 
When doing moves and attacks that require a back movement while on full 
POW, the computer always likes to make you start the Flesh Flail anyway, 
so be careful. You are lagged for a second or two after your 
invulnerability and you can get tagged badly if you did not expect/plan 
to do it.
 
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
COMBOS:
(Some Taken From Strategy/Combo Faq v.01)
(NOTE: These are just combos that have worked in the past, or have been 
confirmed. This is currently not an exhaustive list by far.)
-> Jump forward C or D kick, standing close B slash into C Lion's Tail
-> Standing A, Low CD, into C Lion's Tail
-> Blood Mist Slice, Standing AB, AB Kabuki Flame, Standing A
-> Blood Mist Slice, Standing A, C Lion's Tail
-> Straight up jumping AB followed by a back-AB when you land (Swear to God)
-> Blood Mist Slice, Dance of the Demon, and a close, crouching AB can 
hit multiple times.
 
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
FIGHTING THE SPECIAL CHARACTERS:
 
Kuroko (The Judge):
	I finally fought him for the first time recently. For all the 
watchers who are trying to figure out when he shows up, he originally 
challenged a Jubei player who thrashed me with a special moves bazar. Use 
of special moves have anything to do with it? Couldn't tell you.
	As far as strategy, this guy is pretty impossible. I know that I 
will not have enough opportunities to fight him in the arcade as I did 
with Mizuki (you can't continue a game after you lose to Kuroko), but I 
can offer some hints on staying alive with Kyoshiro against him:
 
	- Use A and C attacks. Anything that has any lag time longer than 
an A or C attack is countered very quickly. I actually got quite a rally 
going by just countering him coming in with As and Cs, but he still got 
to me. The point here is keep your attacks quick.
 
	- Keep a defensive posture at all times. Kuroko whips out special 
moves faster than Mizuki. Always stay low and stay blocking. Use 
'back-slash' or 'back-kick' attacks so you can stay blocking. It lessens 
the damage he can sneak in on you.
 
	- Dodge and counter. Get really good at ducking and rolling and 
you can dodge his attacks and follow up with an A or C barrage, and roll 
back out. It was the only semi-successful tactic I found.
 
	This is by no means authoritative. It is just the listing of 
tactics that were most successful in my brief encounter. I appreciate all 
other input on fighting him with Kyoshiro.
 
Mizuki Rashoushin (End Boss):
	It is my firm conviction that Mizuki Rashoushin is 'Bullshit 
Damage' in Japanese. She is the queen of the bullshit moves that do mega 
damage. She can hit with multiple attacks at the same time. At one time 
once, I was hit with the Mass Confusion, Swine Curse, and her special 
(Hell Storm) all at once. Needless to say, I was dead. I can offer some 
general tips on how to stay alive long enough to kill her. I've finished 
the game on one credit, so this strategy does work.
 
	- Stay in the air. 6 times out of 10, its the best place to be. 
She seems to be partially susceptible to air attacks, keeping off the 
ground saves you from getting dragged into her Portal to Hell, and it is 
a good place to be against most of her projectile powers. You can also 
catch her most of the time when she is doing her teleport. Be careful, as 
you cannot jump over her Mass Confusion, but you CAN get in a hit while 
also getting hit by it, and sometimes that it a good trade, if you can 
get used to reverse joystick movements (like me). You want to do as much 
damage as possible with each hit, so in the air is the place to be.
 
	- Stay away from her. In close, she will kick your ass hard and 
fast. Use As and Cs to knock her back fast. Keeping back also lets you 
see what she is doing and react to her, which is the only way to survive. 
You are fodder in close. Don't be there. If you can get to the 'K' spot, 
you can get in with an AB or B while she is preparing special moves.
 
	- Use her special moves against her. After a while, you will 
learn what each one looks like. Outside of nabbing her while she is 
preparing them, your key to success is to know what each attack will do 
and hit her while she is vulnerable. If she uses any of the demon dog 
attacks, jump over it and nail her with a jumping AB. If she throws a 
Mass Confusion at you, block it and follow up with a B or jump into it 
with a jumping AB which will do more damage to her than you. If she 
throws a Portal to Hell at you, jump it with an AB. Ditto her Teleport.
 
	- Be very careful when her POW meter is full. He POW special 
(Hell Storm) can get you going BOTH ways, so watch it. She tends to start 
rapid fire specials when she is at full POW, and if you get hit by one of 
them, go back to the well for another 50 cents.

WHAT HAPPENS WHEN KYOSHIRO WINS:
   WHAT HAPPENED WHEN HE WON IN SS:
   (From SSfaq v.12.0)
 
  Ending scene description:
    Kyoshiro says, "Having been trounced, I think you now realize the
  sublimity of Kabuki."  He looks at the background.  "Hey, what a great
  place.  Why, of course..."  Cut to a big curtain on the screen. "Lords,
  Ladies, come hither."   It opens up, revealing the musicians from Tokyo
  sitting around Amakusa's area and a big audience at the bottom of the
  screen.  Kyoshiro comes out and starts dancing and whipping his hair
  around.  The audience cheers and throw flowers.
 
 
 
WHAT YOU GET IF YOU FINISH THE NEW GAME WITH KYOSHIRO:
(Ending Info Taken From Tapfaq v.3.0)
 
  Kyoshiro is standing on the cliff, overlooking the forest.  He says, 
"I've had enough of dancing solo.  I'll dance in pairs next."  He then sees 
something and leaps off the cliff into the forest.
  Scene changes to forest.  Mizuki is lying unconscious on the ground.  
Kyoshiro takes a puff of his pipe, and tosses "dust" onto Mizuki, which 
awakens her.  She stands and says, "I can move on my own will.  I'm free 
now."   Kyoshiro says, "You tried to control him but he did control you."
Mizuki says, "I thought I was the strongest, but my pride gave him the 
chance to control me."  Kyoshiro points to the sky, and Mizuki looks.  In a
flash, the scene changes to Kyoshiro's background.  He says, "Well, I'll 
tell you the best job to train your mind.  It's the job to dance a Kabuki
with me, and popularize it among the people."  A heart flutters up from
Mizuki, and she smiles and nods.  Then, while she plays a flute, Kyoshiro
goes on a wild Kabuki dance for everyone.
