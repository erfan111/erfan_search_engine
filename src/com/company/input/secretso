INTRODUCTION
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Welcome to the fourth issue of "Secrets of the SEGA Sages." This list
contains hundreds of playing tips, secrets, Easter eggs, and passwords
for Sega Genesis and Sega CD video games.  As always, new or updated
items are marked with the word "*NEW*" and corrections with the word
"*FIXED*."

Here's a little background for the history buff.  In the not-so-distant
past, Bryan Newell created a list called "Sega Genesis Secrets" and
maintained it until he sold his Genesis.  Bob Rusbasan took over the
list on October 20, 1991, and has maintained it and a similar list for
CD games since then.  In November of 1993, I merged his two lists,
rewrote the result for consistency, and added many new items.  The
result is the file you are reading now. 

I hope you enjoy this list, and ask that you please help by sending
corrections, suggestions, and contributions to SEGA@SUNSITE.UNC.EDU.
When submitting a contribution, please use the current format.  Thank
you.

P.S.  I am sorry to say that this may be the last list for a few
      months.  I've been too busy to gather secrets, and I've received
      very few submissions.  If you have anything to contribute,
      no matter how small, please send submissions to
      sega@sunsite.unc.edu.  Thank you.

CHAKAN

       (Elemental Plane)  To get to the elemental plane, you need the
       potions for "teleport alchemy".  Take these potions to the little
       ledge above the air portal.  Use the potions here and you'll be
       teleported to the elemental plane!
       
       (God Powers)  Give yourself all the potions and weapons you want
       with this code!  Immediately after turning on the game, hold down C
       and START buttons on both controllers.  You should hear a funny
       sound.  To get all the weapons, enter the Alchemy Screen and press
       UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT on Controller Two.  To get all the potions,
       enter the Alchemy Screen and press START, A, B, C on Controller
       Two.
       
       (Level Select)  Enable God Powers.  Whenever you want to switch
       levels, press B.  A menu (of sorts) should appear in the lower left-
       hand corner.  Press B to scroll through the levels, and press START
       to warp to your selection.
       

CHUCK ROCK

       (Skip Level)  At the title screen, press A, B, RIGHT, A, C, A,
       DOWN, B, RIGHT, A.  After you do this, press and hold A, B, and C
       and press START.  While you are in the starting level, press UP
       while holding A.  This will advance you do the next level.  If you
       do this in each level, you will warp all the way to the very last
       level where you will be able to fight the last boss by pressing
       RIGHT and A together.
       

COLUMNS

       (Magic Jewel)  Here's a trick to summon the magic jewel.  Play the
       game in Easy Arcade mode.  When you begin to lose, fill the far
       left or far right two columns as high as possible with jewels.
       When you've completed the column, a magic jewel will appear.
       
       (Extra Magic Jewels)  There is a way to trick the game into giving
       you a second magic jewel.  To do this you must set up the screen in
       a certain way.  Have one row of the normal jewels stacked up almost
       to the top of the playfield.  There must be vertical space for only
       two of the three jewels in the next block to come on the screen.
       Watch the "Next Block" preview box.  When you see that the magic
       jewel block is next, get ready to quickly move it on top of your
       prepared stack.  After the magic jewel eliminates the 'touching'
       color jewels, all of the remaining jewels will drop down as will
       the one magic jewel that was off the screen.  This magic jewel will
       drop down and eliminate another group of colored jewels!
       
       (Free Points)  To get a fast and easy 10,000 bonus points, have one
       vertical column empty all the way to the bottom of the playfield.
       When you get the block of magic jewels, position it so that it
       falls down this column, all the way to the bottom.  Since you don't
       get to use it to eliminate any colored jewels, the game gives you
       10,000 points instead.

       this correctly you will hear a tone.  Immediately afterwards, you
       will see the "Level Completed" screen and will advance to the next
       level, where you will be invincible.
       

CRUE BALL

       (Skip Level)  Choose "Music Demo" from the title menu and select #6
       (Twisted Flipper).  Now press A, C, A, B and begin the game.
       Before you launch the ball, press and hold UP and B to advance to
       the next level.  To back up, press and hold DOWN and B.
       
       (Sound Test)  Do the Skip Level.  You'll be able to enter a full
       sound test at any time during the game by pressing A, B, and C
       together.
       

CYBERBALL

       (Playing Tips)  Here are some playing tips.
       
       Easy scores on offense:
       
       *  Axle Grind: To score quick touchdowns, throw to the left wide
          receiver.
          
       *  Sunday Ride: For quick yardage to cross the 50 yard line, throw
          to the left running back.
          
       *  Zig-Zag: For quick yardage or for scoring inside the 10 yard line,
          throw to the left running back.

       *  Suicide: To score extra points after touchdowns or for scoring
          inside the 10 yard line throw to the left running back. 
          Defensive moves to stop the computer cold:
       
       *  Prevent: For the sack, blitz your linebacker around the left
          side of the offensive line.
          
       *  3-4 Defense: When the computer is inside your 10 yard line,
          blitz your linebacker around either side.  Be sure to use your
          powerbooster to get to the QB.
          
       Score on kick returns:
       
       To score on kick returns, run between the two men on the right and
       then run up the sideline.  If you do this correctly, you'll score
       everytime!
       

CYBORG JUSTICE

       (More Options)  This trick will give you a new option menu in the
       middle of the game!  First start your game.  Next, make your cyborg
       in the asssembly room.  Go into the actual game and pause it after
       you begin game play.  At this point, press C, B, B, C, C, A, C, B
       very quickly!  If you have done this correctly a new Options screen
       will appear.
       

DAVID ROBINSON'S SUPREME COURT

       (Passwords)  Here are two passwords for this game.
       
        ================================

        Championship          IIDSREQ3R
        ================================

       (Change Game Length)  To adjust the length of your game, enter the

       the quarter lengths from 15 minutes to 20 seconds.
       

DECAPATTACK

       (Airwalk)  To walk on air, jump and press C rapidly.
       
       (Life Refill)  You probably know that the red poles can throw you
       long distances, but did you know they can heal you?  Use the
       airwalk to position yourself over one of the poles, then drop
       straight down onto it.  Each time you do this you will gain a half
       of your heart back and one of the segments on the pole will turn
       white.
       
       (Skip Second Boss)  Here's how to bypass the second round boss.  As
       you approach the last fall before Toady (the second boss), float to
       the ledge on your left and then jump from ledge to ledge until you
       see the sign that says you've cleared the round.  Be careful,
       though, you must get the special item before you leave the level.
       If you fail to do this, you will have to go back to the level and
       find the item, plus you will run into the second round boss!

       jump up the platforms to the top and you'll get a 1-up.  Next fight
       through the level until you get to the point where you're right
       before the magic book.  Take the magic book and keep moving to the
       right until you see a treasure chest.  Go into the chest and you'll
       come out just past the platforms.  Go to the left and jump back up
       the platforms.  Do this trick as many times as you would like!
       

FATAL FURY

       (Unlimited Continues)  Here is a tip to get unlimited continues.
       After losing, the Continue screen will come up with the number of
       credits shown in the left-hand corner.  Hold UP and press A, B and
       C simultaneously.  Release A, B and C, then press them again to
       gain a credit.  This trick can be repeated as often as desired.
       
       (Never Ending Fight)  Choose "Control" from the Options menu, then
       highlight the Point option.  Next, hold B and set point to 0.  Now
       challenge a friend to a two-player "Vs." battle.  Your point globes
       will be replaced by counters that show how many rounds you've won.
       To end the game, press RESET.
       

FATAL LABYRINTH

       Select to "Hard" instead of "Easy."
       

FLASHBACK

       (Walk Through Walls)  While playing, walk up to any wall.  Turn
       away from the wall, then hold A and press away from the wall.
       (I.e., if the wall is on your right, face right, hold A and press
       RIGHT.)  The instant Conrad starts to run, release A and face
       toward the wall.  He should be able to walk through it.  Note that
       this appears to be a bug, as if you walk through a wall with
       nothing behind it you'll die or crash the game.
       
       (Passwords)  Here are all the passwords to Flashback in easy,
       normal and expert mode.  To see the ending, enter "CYGNUS".

       (Campaign 5, Attack Cycle)  To get the Special Forces Attack Cycle,
       you must destroy the Computer Labs.  The labs are the two black
       high-rise buildings in the downtown area.  After you've destroyed
       them, go to the Police Station and shoot out the Radar Dish.
       Finally, land the chopper and get the Cycle.
       
       (Campaign 6, Power-Ups)  The Snow Fortress is one of the hardest
       levels.  Fortunately this is offset with a number of hidden
       goodies.
       
       *  Village Supply Depot: There's a village with hidden power-ups to the
          left of the starting point.  You'll find it next to the Igloo and
          the Landing Pad.  To grab the power-ups you'll need to battle two
          tanks and some soldiers, but the results are worth it.  Blow up the
          building to reveal the Super Winch, an Extra Life, and Armor Repair.
          
       *  More Armor Repair: You'll find another Armor Repair South of the POW
          camp.  To find it, destroy the building South of the guard tower.
          You'll find another disguised as a snow dune in an underground
          tunnel.  It's Southeast of the POW camp, near two barren trees and
          an enemy chopper. 
          
       (Campaign 7, Extra Lives / Armor Repair)  In Campaign 7 there are
       four lives hidden just northeast of the Landing Pad in the
       beginning of the campaign.  Blast the pyramids to reveal them.
       There are also three Armor Repairs in this campaign.  The first is
       in the sector's upper-left area, under the Humvee and next to the
       Radar.  Another is in the upper-fright sector, under a Sheridan
       Tank.  The third is under a Humvee, between a bridge and a temple
       in the lower-left sector.

       movable blocks.  Get past these and go through the door.  Once
       inside, wait for the flying power to wear off.  Use small leaps to
       open the two chests which contain 1-ups.  Collecting the rest of
       the things in the room will give you points. Exit the room and go
       down, and to the right of the arrow should be another 1-up chest.
       Complete the level and when you are pumping up balloon in the game
       room, lose intentionally.  You will be thrown to the beginning of
       the level, but you will have only lost one life.  All of the items
       will be in the exact same place, so you can go through and get the
       1-ups again.

          the child on that floor to get the shooting star. 

       *  In round 3-2, rescue the first girl, located behind the rock.
          
       *  In level 3-3 go to the left side of the waterfall.  Look straight up
          and rescue the child above you.
          
       In all of these cases, the child-hostage noted must be the first
       one rescued when you reach that level.
       

MICKEY MOUSE: CASTLE OF ILLUSION

       (Secret Passageways)  There are several hidden passageways in this
       game.  Here are a few to get you started.
       
       *  Level 1-1: To find Level One's secret passage jump down from the
          second angled ledge and go underground.  The first passageway to the
          left has a false wall which Mickey can pass through.  At the end of
          the passageway there's a variety of bonus goodies.
          
       *  Level 1-2: Go to the cliff by the forth rope and drop off the left
          side while holding to the right and you'll get ten apples!
          
       *  Level 1-4: Jump into the hole by the fifth tree and walk to the left
          through the rocks to find a room with a free mouse and two stars.
          
       *  Level 3-1: There's an identical secret passageway, just before you
          go underground.  Proceed just as in Level 1-1 and you'll find
          another false wall and goody room. 

       *  Level 4-3: When you find a tea cup, jump in for a swim and you'll
          find all types of power-ups.  Be careful of the sugar cubes!
          
       (Ghost Mickey)  Hold down A, B, and C, then press START.  You will
       now be able to fly through the air, walls, enemies, and items!
       Repeat to return to normal.
       
       (Max Out Your Marbles)  At the end of the second level in Toyland,
       you'll come across a bag of marbles.  If you pick the bag up and
       proceed to the right far enough, when you go back to the left, the
       bag will reappear.  Each time you pick the bag up, you'll receive
       1,000 points and extra marbles (up to 30).
       
       (Max Out Your Points)  As long as you are on the vines in the
       second part of level 1-1, you're invincible.  Swing on the vine and
       get all the points you want and up to ten men.  You'll average
       about 95,000 points an hour.

                       You can pick a set order or choose
                       "Random" which allows the computer to
                       choose one for you.  This takes effect
                       for the game and for the demo.
                       
          MATERIAL     Picks the material for the "Test Your
                       Might" screen.
                       
          CHOP 1/2     Picks the number of rounds between each
                       "Test Your Might" screen.  Takes effect

                       "Test Your Might".

                       the "Test Your Might Screen," chopping

          FLAG 0       Brings the right player's energy to
                       DANGER at beginning of the round.  If
                       Reptile appears, the player has full
                       strength for the first match.  During
                       endurance matches, the second opponent
                       has full strength.
                       
          FLAG 1       Brings the left player's energy to DANGER
                       at beginning of round.  If Reptile
                       appears, the player has full strength for
                       the first match.  During endurance
                       matches, the second opponent has full
                       strength.
                       
          FLAG 2       Guarantees shadow appearances on the Pit
                       Stages.
                       
          FLAG 3       Changes shadows on the moon to a face or
                       the initials "BYC".  Works when the
                       sound, music, and effects test are not
                       all set to 1.
                       
          FLAG 4       Reptile appears with hints at the start
                       of each stage.
                       
          FLAG 5       Infinite continues (credits never
                       decrease).
                       
          FLAG 6       The computer will use fatalities.
                       
          FLAG 7       Locks background screen as "The
                       Courtyard" until the fight before Goro.
                       
          BLOOD CODE   Turns the blood on and off just like
                       ABACABB.
                       
          CHEAT CODE   Turns off all cheats and clears all flags
                       (FLAG 1, 2, ...).  If the cheat menu is
                       exited with CHEAT CODE off, the Cheat
                       Enabled choice disappears from the menu.
                       
          FIRST        Chooses which background appears first.
          BACKGROUND   
          
       (Guaranteed Reptile Fight)  Enable the Cheat Menu.  Now go to the
       cheat menu and set FIRST BACKGROUND to "The Pit", FLAG 1 to ON and
       FLAG 2 to ON.  When you start, you're at the pit screen, and the
       moon shadows will always be there (you'll see Santa Claus, the
       witch, etc.)  To guarantee a fight with Reptile, never block, get a
       double flawless, and do the fatality.  Good luck!
       
*NEW*  (Hidden Character)  There is a glitch in the game that allows you
       to play aginst another character not meant to be there.  It's not
       like Reptile, who was programmed in.  Instead, it looks similar
       to the old "boss" code for the original SNES Street Fighter II.
       To get to this character, you must first put in the blood code
       and the cheat code.  Turn on flags 0 and 2.  Now, when you get to
       the endurance matches one of them must be in the Pit.  Beat the
       character without using block, get a double flawless victory, and
       perform the fatality.  Reptile will once again appear.  Beat him,
       and the hidden character will jump down.  It may take some work,
       but give it a try!


MUHAMMAD ALI'S HEAVYWEIGHT BOXING

       (Harder Game)  For an unusual match, enter the password "H07007Z"
       while in Tournament mode.  You'll be fighting as Ali with a #1
       ranking, no wins, and no losses.  Your opponent is an elderly
       gentleman named Ali Mohammed.  This guy looks strangely familiar,
       except for the white eyebrows, mustache, and clothing.  Don't let
       appearances deceive you, he may look rickety, but he's tough as
       nails.
       
       (Easier Game)  For a more run-of-the-mill fight, enter "H074W57Z"
       while in Tournament mode.  You'll then be fighting for the title as
       Ali with a number-two ranking, 40 wins, and no losses.

MYSTICAL FIGHTER

       (Bonus Screens)  Here's how to find three hidden bonus screens.
       
       1.   The first screen is located in the first half of level one.  Near the
            beginning of the level, you pass a small red building followed by two pairs
            of sliding doors.  Push UP in front of the sliding doors.  Inside, you'll
            find many crates with special items.
            
       2.   The second bonus screen is in level two.  When you reach the
            waterfall, press UP in front of the middle of the falls.  Catch raindrops
            to restore your health.
            
       3.   The third bonus screen is in level four.  At the beginning of the
            level, you'll see a small bridge made of logs.  Press UP in the middle of
            the bridge.  This screen is similar to the first bonus screen.

REVENGE OF SHINOBI

       number of shurikens.

       are revealed only by shooting them.  On the first platform, jump
       and shoot and you'll reveal a 2-up on the platform across your
       position.  Get it, die, and repeat!  There's another 2-up on level
       3-2.  Go to the second elevator and locate the crates that are in
       the middle of the screen (on the second level).  Then shoot the
       bottom-left crate until the 2-up appears.
       
       (Special Bonus)  Finish any level with enough shurikens to equal 11
       times the number of lives remaining, and you will receive 30,000
       bonus points (i.e., if you have 7 lives left, finish the round with
       exactly 77 shurikens).

       (Passwords)  Try these passwords to give you a top bike and a large
       sum of money for each level.  Note the difference between the (O)
       and the zero (0).
       
        ==============================

       start you on the fourth level with over $7,000,000!
       

ROAD RASH 2

       (Bike Select)  Begin your game and go to the Options screen.
       Choose "Set Player Mode" and select "Mano A Mano" at any level.
       Then exit and go to the Bike Shop.  Choose any bike you'd like.
       Return to the Options screen and select "Set Player Mode" again.
       Next, choose the type of game you want.  Select "Take Turns" and
       copy the password.  Use the password to race with the bike you've
       chosen!  When it's player two's turn, they can choose their bike
       with the same procedure.
       
       (Super Bike)  At the title screen, press and hold UP, A and C
       simultaneously, then press START.  You'll receive a super bike, the
       "Wild Thing 2000", which goes 200 mph, has unlimited Nitrous, and
       can't spin or slide out!
       
       (Extra Level)  If you qualify on all five tracks of level 5, you
       will advance to a special level 6 in which you race all cops.  The
       password "8PC8 5VNE" will put you at level 5, qualified on all
       tracks except Arizona.  This is the only way to get there since the
       password system does not work for level 6.
       
       (Password Structure)  The following is a breakdown of the password
       structure.  This description is rather technical and offers of
       rewrites will be greatly appreciated.
       
          X    X    X    X         X    X    X    X
          |     |    |    |         |    |    |    |
          |     |    |    |         |    |    |    Checksum
          |     |    |    |         |    |    |
          |     |    |    |         |    |    Tracks Qualified
          |     |    |    |         |    |
          |     |    |    |         |    Bike (high 4 bits)
          |     |    |    |         |
          |     |    |    |         Level (low 3 bits)
          |     |    |    |
          -Money in $10's-
           (high 4 bits)
          
       Each of the eight password characters is a 5-bit value represented
       by the characters "0" (00000) through "V" (11111).
       
       The first four characters of the password how much money you have
       in units of $10.  Only the high-order 4 bits of each of these
       characters are used; the use of the low-order bit is unknown, but
       it contributes to the checksum in the 8th character.
       
       The 5th character indicates the current level (1-5) in the low
       order three bits.
       
       The 6th character indicates one of the 16 available bikes in the
       high-order 4 bits as a value from 0 (intro bike) to 15 (binary
       1111, "Wild Thing", available only through a special startup
       sequence or via the password).
       
       The 7th character indicates the tracks on which you have qualified
       in the order (high bit to low bit) Vermont, Arizona, Tennessee,
       Hawaii and Alaska.
       
       The 8th character is a checksum.
       
       HOW TO GET MORE MONEY:
       
       To increase the amount of money you have by tens of thousands of
       dollars, increase the value in character 1 in increments of 2 and
       decrease the value in character 2 by the same amount (you must
       adjust both to allow the checksum value in the 8th character to
       remain valid).
       
       HOW TO INCREASE LEVEL:
       
       Increase the 5th character by one to four (to a maximum value of
       "5") and also increase the 8th character by the same amount.  If
       you get "password invalid", try changing the 8th character until it
       works.
       
       HOW TO SELECT A DIFFERENT BIKE:
       
       Increase the 6th character in steps of 2 and decrease the 4th
       character by the same amount.  This will also slightly reduce your
       money, but it allows the checksum value (character 8) to remain
       valid.  To select the undocumented bike named "Wild Thing", you
       must be on the intro bike, set the 6th character to "V" then
       increase the 4th character by 2.
       
       HOW TO MARK TRACKS AS QUALIFIED:
       
       Select the appropriate value for the 7th character then experiment
       with the 8th character until the password is accepted.  For
       example, to qualify on all tracks but Arizona, the value 10111 is
       required, which translates to an "N" (see description above).
       Change the 7th character to "N" then find an 8th character that
       works.
       

ROBOCOP vs. TERMINATOR

       (Extra Lives)  On level 2 there is a secret portal that will
       transfer you to the OCP Underground Offices.  When you get there
       you will be fighting against Red Terminators.  If you succeed you
       will receive some extra lives.  To get there, ride the second
       tightrope and fall.  Walk behind the building (behind the wall) and
       jump (like you're jumping over something).  If you did it right you
       will be teleported.

          and shoot a 1-Up.
          
       *  Stage 3-1 -- On the third floor, walk to the far right.  There's a
          man on the two boxes.  Shoot him with a power shuriken, go to the
          next level and you'll be able to jump down and retrieve a 2-Up.

SONIC THE HEDGEHOG

       (Level Select)  At the title screen, hold A then press UP, DOWN,
       LEFT, RIGHT, then you will hear a chime.  Then hit START.  You can
       then start from any level or test the sounds.  If that doesn't
       work, try this: at the title screen, press UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT,
       hold A, and press START.  After doing this once, you only need to
       hold START and A to enter the level select.
       
       (Get All Emeralds)  This cheat allows you to start at the First
       Level with all the Emeralds, and with lots of Continues.  Use the
       Level Select cheat (see above) to get to the Special Zone.  When
       you get the Emerald, and have entered into the First Zone, press
       RESET.  Use the Level Select cheat to get to the Special Zone
       again.  When you get the next Emerald, and have entered the First
       Zone, press RESET again.  When you finally have all the Emeralds do
       not press RESET, just continue on with First Level.  You get to
       keep the Emeralds and the Continues accumulated so far.
       
       (Control Mode)  At the title screen, press U, C, D, C, L, C, R.
       Or, if that doesn't work, try this: Quickly press C four times,
       then press U, D, L, R repeatedly until you hear a chime.  This will
       give you special techniques during the game: While paused, pressing
       A will reset the game, pressing B will allow you to play in slow-
       motion (while B is held down), and pressing C will advance the game
       one frame at a time.
       
       (Debug Mode)  Enter Control Mode.  After pressing START to begin a
       game, hold down A until you see Sonic on the screen.  If you see a
       bunch of hex numbers on the top of the screen, you're in Debug
       Mode.  To start "debugging," press B, then you can select any
       sprite in that level and put it on the screen.  To select a
       different sprite, press A, and to place it on the screen, press C.
       Note that sprite selection is different from Zone to Zone.  Also,
       instead of displaying the time elapsed, it displays the number of
       sprites currently on the screen.  Control Mode functions work as
       well.  This only works on the first production releases of Sonic.
       
       (Confused Demo)  You can confuse Sonic during the demo by pressing
       all three action buttons repeatedly.  Sonic will lose his place in
       the pattern and possibly even die.

       appear, hold down A and press START.  This will let you choose the
       level in which you begin your game.  When playing, you can pause
       the game and use A to restart, B for slow motion, and C for frame
       advance.
       
       (Super Sonic)  To become Super Sonic without getting all the Chaos
       Emeralds, first enable the level select.  At the level select menu,
       go to the sound test item, and play sounds in this order: 4, 1, 2,
       6.  You should hear the music you get when you win a chaos emerald.
       Now select any level, get 50 rings, and jump.
       
       (More Continues)  First enable the level select.  Then, at the
       options screen, play these sounds in this order: 1, 1, 2, 4.  Now
       move the highlight to the "Player Select" field of the options
       screen and press START.
       
       (Debug)  To enter debug mode, play these sounds from the level
       select screen: 1, 9, 9, 2, 1, 1, 2, 4.  Press START and hold A.

       (Get All Chaos Emeralds)  Start the game as you normally would.
       Get a chaos emerald, reset the game, and start the game from the
       options menu.  You will keep the emeralds you have gained so far
       each time you start from the options menu.
       
       (Super Tails)  While in DEBUG mode, pick the monitor.  It should be
       a transfer box.  When you hit it and you are Super Sonic, you lose
       all your powers but stay yellow.  Tails looks the same but has
       invincibility (little stars flashing around him).

       the game, you can pause and press A to refill your web-shooter, B
       to refill your life, C for five seconds of invincibility, and all
       three buttons to skip to the next level.
       
       (Short Cut to First Boss)  Go to the Options screen and select
       "Nightmare" difficulty.  Play the game and get into the first level
       warehouse.  Proceed to the right, past the first thug and then past

       containers, then jump INTO the rocks above.  If you time it right
       you'll get caught in the rock and be pulled into a secret room.
       Keep trying until it happens.  When you are pulled in, you'll have
       to fight the Phantom.  Once he is destroyed, climb the wall to the

       and you will appear in a deserted village.  Walk around the first

       walk onto the brick wall!  Walk left again into the patch of trees

       find 10,000 gold pieces!

       search the ground. Each time you do this you'll get 30 experience
       points.

       instead of the trophy!
       
       (Getting Even)  If the spirit of the bumping and pushing in the
       race is getting to you, there is a way that you can get even.
       Unfortunately, it's going to cost you!  As you near the finish line
       and are in first, second, or third place, look for the man who is
       waving the checkered flag.  Run into him and watch him fly off into
       the air!  Be warned that you'll get no points.

SWORD OF SODAN

       (High Score Warp)  Make the highest score on the high-score screen.
       Enter your name as "HINANP:)" and start a new game.  Press START on
       Controller Two to warp to the next level.
       
       (Potion Warp)  Drink four Etherium potions at once to warp to the
       next level.
       
       (Free Life)  Drink the first two potions on level one for a free
       life.
       
       (Potion Combinations)  Here are a few potions you can mix. You can
       use the shield on level six to walk across the lava.
       
          Red and Orange = Flaming Sword
          Orange, Blue and Grey = Super Zapper
          Blue and Grey = Shield

SWORD OF VERMILION

       (Increase Armor Class)  In the cave to the east of Hastings, you'll
       find the "Old Nick" armor.  Don't equip it yet.  Instead, head back
       to Swaffham to find Raphael's Stick.  Now put on the Old Nick armor
       -- your armor class will go up, but you'll be cursed.  Use
       Raphael's Stick to undo the curse.  You'll notice that your armor
       class is now lower.  Take the armor off, then repeat the entire
       process of equipping the armor, using the stick, and removing it.
       Do this until your armor class is below zero.  Your armor class
       should then become very high.  Keep taking off and putting on the
       armor until your armor class once again goes below zero.  Now, you
       should have an armor class of more than 9000!  Your character is
       almost invincible, taking only one damage point per hit no matter
       who you're fighting--even against Tsarkon!

       (Bonus Rounds)  There are three circular rainbow symbols that will
       let you play three bonus rounds if you find them.
       
       *   In Stage 1, play the area in the lower-right corner of the map,
           directly below the red boss area.  When you find Gogo at the far
           right side of the area, drop to the ground and go right past the
           rats to find the rainbow symbol.
            
       *   In Stage 2, play the area that has the word "TINY" spelled out with
           carrots.  Go past "TINY" and walk right to the edge of the cliff.
           Drop off the cliff and push LEFT to land in a hidden tunnel.  Walk
           left and grab the 1-Up and Bell, then walk left again and drop onto
           the rainbow symbol.
            
       *   In Stage 3, play the area that has the split waterfall.  Play until
           you walk onto a ledge that starts moving upward.  Jump off the
           ledge before you're smashed into the ceiling.  Follow the tunnel to
           the left until you reach gray platforms.  Drop down the platforms
           to a half-pipe with a rolling boulder.  Walk left and jump into the
           wall on the left side of the pipe to enter a hidden tunnel.  The
           rainbow symbol is at the end of the tunnel.
            

TOEJAM & EARL

       (Healing / Extra Life)  You start the game on level one, which
       appears to consist solely of two islands in the water.  However, if
       you jet ski, fly, or ride an inner tube to the lower left part of
       level 1, you will find another island with a hole in it.  Fall down
       the hole to level 0, where you can be healed (in the hot tub) and
       receive an extra life (by drinking lemonade).  When you leave level
       0, you will return to the highest level you have visited.
       
       (Secret Island)  In addition to the island with the hole described
       above, there is another island on the upper right of Level 1 that
       has many presents on it.
       
       (Extra Presents)  You can get 2 or 3 presents from Santa if you
       sneak up on him while he's rummaging through his bag, and stand
       still when he looks up.  Do this until you touch him and he drops
       some presents when he leaves.

       Now press START, and the game will seem to reset, only the color
       and graphics are really weird.  After you get tired of tripping out
       on the groovy colors, hit RESET.  This will return your picture to
       normal, but the code is still in effect.  Now start a game against
       the computer and play away! You will soon discover many oddities.
       
       (Strange Effects)  Enter "RGsiopqm2jhZZSUXVtEEAE" for some strange
       effects during the game.

       World Series options.  Fill in the blanks in the password,
       "H__flmnjiaVXhLQZPqBCVA".  The two blanks represent the first and
       second teams.  To select the opposition team (second blank), input
       the next consecutive letter of the team in the chart (i.e., Detroit
       as the first team would be 'D', but as the second team they would
       be 'E').  Note that teams marked with an asterisk (*) must play
       against teams marked with a number sign (#).

       seconds, then release START.  You can now select any level by

       (Temporary Invincibility)  If you have a magic item, but not quite
       enough MPs to do magic, invoking Magic will cause your character to
       "go through the motions" with no payoff.  However, she is
       invulnerable while doing this; the flaming knives of Glames will go
       right through her to no effect.  This effect only lasts a second,
       however; therefore it is useless against any slow-moving
       adversaries or lingering firepower.

       START.  Now you can watch any of the cinema displays, including the

X-MEN

       (More Time)  In the upper right-hand corner of the Danger Room
       there is a box with wires on it.  Smash the box and your time limit
       in the Danger Room will increase from 30 seconds to 1 minute and 30
       seconds.
       
       (Level Select)  Before performing this trick, turn off your Genesis
       and disconnect Controller Two.  Now press and hold DOWN, A, and C
       while you turn on the system.  Continue to hold these buttons, then
       press and hold START at the "Press Start" screen until you reach
       the Difficulty Select screen.  Select any difficulty level and
       character, and walk to the right when the game begins.  If
       everything has gone correctly, you will see eight panels on the
       wall representing the eight levels.  Crouch down in front of one of
       the panels and press C to warp to that level.
       
       (Gambit Level Skip)  Using Gambit only, you can bypass the first
       three levels.  When inside the danger room, go up to the control
       room (upper left-hand corner).  As you begin to disappear, hold
       down the A button.  The level will start, but you will immediately
       return to the danger room.  After the first level, you will start
       in Zaladane's Fortress, but you can repeat the trick and skip to
       the Shiar world and skip again to Excalibur's Lighthouse.  Before
       proceeding to Level Four, you can replenish all of Gambit's power
       and choose your favorite X-Men superhero.  This enables you to
       start Level Four with all your X-Men at full strength.

AFTERBURNER III

       (Easier Game)  Here is a way to get through this game with greater
       ease.  At the title screen, choose Options and set View mode to
       "Cockpit" and Rolling mode to "Free."  Now, take off in your plane
       and turn your Afterburners on to the limit of their capacity.
       Also, turn your plane to a 45 degree angle and fly this way with
       your guns blazing.  You will be going so fast, barely anything can
       touch you.  You will still get hit, and sometimes even blow up, but
       the levels will pass by quickly and much easier than before.  When
       you have to go straight, just quickly move up and down to avoid
       shots.  When someone is on your tail, do 180 degree turns to avoid
       them.
       

BATMAN RETURNS

       highlighting the following options: 1, 7, 1, 6, 7.  If you did this
       correctly you will hear a loud beep.  To select a level, point to
       the option who's number matches the level on which you wish to play
       (i.e., to play on level 1, highlight "1: Game Type.")  Now press
       and hold LEFT and B.
       
       (Skip Level)  From the title screen, select "Options."  Set Game
       Type to "Driving Only."  Next, hold LEFT and press B.  Move down to
       Difficulty, hold LEFT and press B.  Do this all the way down
       through number 7 on the Options screen.  Once you reach the last
       option on the bottom, repeat the procedure all the way back up to
       the "Game Type" option.  If you do this right you will hear a
       ringing noise.  Now, choose your options as normal and start the
       game.  While playing, you can skip levels by pressing C while the
       game is paused.

       killed instead of being sent back to the beginning of the level.
       This also apparently adds several other new difficulties.

       that was shot in Pawtucket, Rhode Island in December of 1986 when
       Tom Zito and company first demonstrated a prototype of the ill-
       fated NEMO game system for a group of Hasbro executives.  Milton
       Bradley's Larry Bernstein is seen playing "Scene of the Crime,"
       which eventually became "Night Trap."
       
       (Time Codes) The following times will get you through the game if
       you follow them to the second.  If nothing is happening when you
       get to an area of the house, wait a few seconds.  Some times may
       have as much as a five-second lead time, but other times have no
       lead at all.  Be quick, and don't wait for traps to close, except
       in the bathroom at 0:35.  Also, be very careful when the Augers
       grab the girls.  The Augers might just drop the girls into the trap
       you had waiting for them!  Finally, wait for the meter to turn red
       a second time after the Augers grab Megan in Hallway 1 at 16:46.
