The USA home version is censored -- the blood is *green* and there are no
"cut him in half" fatalities. However, as has been posted recently to
rec.games.video.arcade, there are apparently two ways to "uncensor" it.  

I. Select OPTION, change to "Japan" mode.  Exit options.  Select OPTION,
   change back to "USA" mode.  Exit options.  Select START.  You should now
   have the game in English, with *red* blood and fatalities.

II. Select OPTION, make sure game is in "USA" mode.  Move cursor to Exit
    and press all 4 buttons on the controller.  Select START.  The effect
    should be the same as the above.

Thanks to GeeSe Howard, here is the code to play as Kuroko on the home
version. Enter this sequence on the 1P controller before a 2P match:

	UP, DOWN, LEFT, UP, DOWN, RIGHT + A

Thanks to Galen Komatsu and Scott Fujimoto for Kuroko's moves. Most of them
are drawn from other Neo Geo fighter carts.
