All of the following tricks and codes have been confirmed.

*****************************************************************************
Powerups

	The following powerups are to be performed at the "Tonight's 
Match-up Screen.  When you are instructed to hold a button, you can 
either release it when the screen is blank or when the court appears.

Powerup Fire:  
		Press B seven times, then hold Y, B, and Up.  This allows 
		your player to be on fire for the entire game.

Powerup Dunks:  
		If you have a burning desire to jam from just beyond half 
		court, try this.  While rotating the directional pad 360 
		degrees (clockwise), press B thirteen times and hold B 
		on the thirteenth button press.

Powerup Defense:  
		This enables your player to goal tend without penalty.  
		Press B five times, and hold on the fifth button press.

Shooting Percentage:  
		When you do this trick, the clock will show the 
		percentage of your shot.  This helps in finding 
		player's best spots for threes.  While holding 
		down, tap B once, then hold A and B.

Powerup Intercept:  
		This powerup is basically useless, at least in my 
		experience.  While rotating the pad clockwise, tap B.
		Keep rotating and tapping until the court appears.

Powerup Turbo:
		Unlimited turbo for the entire game.  Press B five times,   
		then hold Y, B, and A.

Juice Mode:  
		This makes the speed of game play double.  After you get 
		used to it, you may never want to play at regular speed again.
		Press any button thirteen times, then hold B and X.

Password with Juice Mode:  Use this password to automatically start every 
game in juice mode.  Initials HRY:  QF3B43T/QJY55TF (86-0).

*****************************************************************************
Special Characters:  There are 12 special characters that I know how to 
get.  Anyone who knows how to get the cheerleaders, or anyone else, is 
encouraged to mail me or Paul.  To get the special characters, enter the 
first two initials.  Then place the cursor over the last initial, but do 
not enter.  Then perform the listed button combo.  (Example:  L,S,X.  
Hold L button, hold START button, press X)

STRATGEY SECTION

	There are many ways to be successful on NBA Jam, especially because 
the CPU is so easy.  The best way to steal is to run between the computer when
he inbounds.  He will always pass the ball back to his teammate.  If you are
behind the reciever of the inbounds pass when he passes, you will be in  
perfect position to intercept it.  I have recorded up to 67 steals with 
this techinque!        
	Also, knocking down the cpu is useless for the purpose of getting
steals.  Use the knock down to prevent a pass to an open teammate, or to run
down your opponent's shot clock.
	On offense, only shoot open 3's.  Always remeber that there is 
nothing wrong with two.  An easy way to get an open three is to dish it off
in the middle of a jam.  Head fakes also work some of the time.
		Ranking the attributes: 
		(1) Speed
		(2) Defense
		(3) Three Pointers (tie)
		(3) Dunks (tie)
	If your player is quick, you have an easier time getting open and 
driving to the hoop.  Also, with a lot of speed you can get back on D after
you make a mistake.  Defense is important because it determines how quick and
how high your player jumps and also how good he is at stealing the ball.  
As far as three pointers and dunks are concerned, your game plam will 
determine which one you value the most.
	This is merely an early version of the strategy section.  Look for a 
longer version in the future :)

LAST WORDS

Thank you to the few people who mailed us with questions and comments.  
Also, thank you Acclaim for creating this game.  Mark Turmell deserves much
of the credit for creating the original Jam. :)

I have been asked about mixing codes.  I am not sure of this can be done,
and I will be working on it.  Anyone who has info, please mail Aaron.

We now believe that the picture of the cheerleader printed in EGM was a 
hoax.  They said that if you watch the demo long enough, you will see this
possible special character.  I watched the demo for the longest time, but
this never happened. :(

I will be glad when people stop asking me if Shaq and Jordan are on NBA Jam.
It's not people on the internet, but everyone I talk to about Jam asks me
that.  One guy even claimed he got them on the Sega version.  He said you
had to hold the computer scoreless and go without letting your teammate
score for 10 games in a row.  Food for thought.  

The word is that NBA Jam: Tournament Edition will be available for SNES and  
Genesis around Christmas.  However, it is very possible that this will be
moved into the future.  I guess we'll have to wait it out... :)

Also, has anyone noticed that the computer on TE cheats about twice as much
as on the original arcade Jam?  The other day I won four games in a row, 
then today I lost three consecutive.  At the end of the fourth quarter in
all of these games, the computer would steal the ball from me just as I 
inbounded :(

Congratulations to the Arkansas Razorbacks for capturing the 1994 NCAA 
basketball title!  We Arkansas fans are anxiously awaiting a repeat in 1995!
We are also anticipating seeing Corliss Williamson and Scotty Thurman in a 
future version of Jam !!
