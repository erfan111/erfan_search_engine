________________________

500 years ago, Shang Tsung was banished to the Earth Realm.  With the aid 
of Goro he was to unbalance the furies and doom the planet to a chaotic 
existence.

By seizing control of the Shaolin Tournament he tried to tip the scales 
of order towards chaos.  Only seven warriors survived the battles and 
Shang Tsung's scheme would come to a violent end at the hands of Liu 
Kang.

Facing execution for his failure and the apparent death of Goro, Tsung 
convinces Shao Kahn to grant him a second chance.

Shang Tsung's new plan is to lure his enemies to compete in the Outworld 
where they will meet certain death by Shao Kahn himself.

Now the Kombat Kontinues...

*************************     Introduction     **************************
*************************************************************************

Welcome to the tenth anniversary edition!  ALL moves and fatalities 
listed are now confirmed.  This guide is for game versions 2.0 and up.  
Older machines do not include some of the moves and most of the 
fatalities.  If you find yourself playing on an outdated machine, have 
the owner contact Midway for the new replacement chips. 

If you have any additions send mail directly to me and I will include it 
in the next guide.  Moves and fatalities posted to rec.games.video.arcade 
and alt.games.mk will also be incorporated into this guide.  Credit will 
be given to those who contribute.  This guide will be posted every 
WEDNESDAY until all the moves and fatalities are discovered.  Keep in 
mind that this is posted ONCE a WEEK, and some moves may not be on the 
latest revision.

Andy Eddy of GamePro magazine has generously offered to make this guide 
available through FTP.  The site is netcom.com, and the directory is 
pub/vidgames/faqs.  Thanks Andy!

By popular vote, the order in which the fighters appear will not be 
changed.  Thanks to everyone who responded.  Also, I had no time this 
week to complete the strategy section, but I was able to add all new 
critical information.  Look for Friendships and Babalities in the next
draft along with Kintaro and Shao Kahn strategy.

as 'press LOW PUNCH and BLOCK at the same time'.  Button names are listed 
in all caps.

                    the button.  Other actions may be performed while
                    charging.  If you are hit the charge remains intact.
                    You can also charge a move before a round begins.

               fighter, to keep them from jumping or walking.  Make sure
               you release BLOCK before pressing the required button.

*************************************************************************
****************     Individual Combos and Strategy     *****************
*************************************************************************

Thanks to Henry Tam and Matthew Wallace for helping to write this 
strategy and combo section.

==============
GENERAL COMBOS
==============

     o     Jump Kick - Sweep:  If you are fighting against the computer, 
you can usually follow a jump kick with a foot sweep.  The sweep will hit 
them as they hit the ground.

     o     Sweep - Throw:  After hitting a human opponent with a sweep, 
you can sometimes get in a throw, even if they are blocking down and 
away.  You can also get in a throw after hitting them with moves other 
than the sweep, such as a jump kick or roundhouse.  This only works with 
some of the characters.

     o     Jump Kick - Hop Kick:  Jump kick your opponent low and 
immediately do a hop kick.  This works well for some of the characters, 
including the ninjas and Shang Tsung.

     o     Jump Kick - Missile Weapon:  Jump kick your opponent low and 
immediately do the missile weapon.  It is important to kick them low and 
deep so you can land on the ground quickly and fire your missile weapon.  
Be sure to buffer the move right before you jump kick if you can.

========
LIU KANG
========

Standard Fireball:  This is a good missile weapon to follow after a jump 
kick since it can be fired very quickly.  It also may be done in the air, 
which is useful for hitting jump opponents out of the sky.  Doing the 
fireball in the air can also be used for dodging missile weapons.  If you 
are jumping and your opponent fires their missile weapon, do the fireball 
while still in the air to stay above it.

Crouching Fireball:  This is a very effective move to keep the opponent 
on his toes.  The opponent must block or jump in order to avoid it, just 
ducking can not escape it.  This is good at long range or short range and 
is very hard to retaliate to.  The crouching fireball is very good for 
defense as well, since Kang is very low to the ground.  A late jump kick 
is the only way to hit him while he is crouching.  It can also be used to 
hit the opponent when they are using their missile weapon, and Kang is 
low enough to avoid their missile.

Flying Kick:  This is a fast attack good for catching your opponent off 
guard.  While walking towards your opponent, tap forwards then press HIGH 
KICK when you suspect your opponent will make a move.  The flying kick is 
also good to use after a jump kick.  If your opponent jumps away from you 
or just in front of you execute the flying kick to hit them out of the 
air.  Be cautious with it though, and never do it across the screen 
against a blocking opponent.  You are likely to lose quite a bit of 
damage if blocked.

Bicycle Kick:  Another good suprise attack move.  Keep your finger on LOW 
KICK throughout the round so you can use it when necessary, performing 
other moves while charging.  As with the flying kick, do not use it when 
far away from your opponent or while they are standing and blocking.  It 
is good to use when your opponent jumps away or towards you.  Also, if 
you are thrown or jump kicked, immediately use it when you stand up to 
catch your opponent off guard.  Make sure you release LOW KICK while 
standing on the ground, otherwise the move will not work and you will 
have to recharge.

     o     Jump Kick - Flying Kick:  Jump kick your opponent low and 
immediately do the flying kick.  Start the two forward motion right 
before you hit, then quickly press HIGH KICK.  Sometimes if you do the 
flying kick to fast you will go over your opponent, so make sure you are 
on the ground first.

     o     Hop Punch - Standard Fireball:  Hop punch your opponent in the 
air and immediately do the standard fireball.  Start the two forward 
motion right before you hit, then quickly press HIGH PUNCH.

     o     Jump Kick - Bicycle Kick:  Jump kick your opponent low and 
immediately do the bicycle kick.  Be sure to charge the bicycle kick a 
few seconds before you jump.  Wait until you land on the ground before 
releasing LOW KICK, otherwise the bicycle kick will not work.

     o     Jump Kick - Standard Fireball - Low Fireball:  Jump kick your 
opponent and immediately do a high fireball.  Start the two forward 
motion right before you hit, then quickly press HIGH PUNCH.  If you are 
fighting the computer, you can follow the standard fireball with a ground 
fireball, which the computer will not block.  If you are fighting a 
human, use the bicycle kick after the standard fireball.

========
KUNG LAO
========

     o     Jump Kick - Hat Throw:  Jump kick your opponent low and 
immediately do the hat throw.  Be sure to guide the hat down so it hits 
the falling opponent.

===========
JOHNNY CAGE
===========

     o     Jump Kick - Shadow Kick:  Jump kick your opponent low and 
immediately do the shadow kick.

     o     Jump Kick - Shadow Uppercut:  Jump kick you opponent low and 
immediately do the shadow uppercut.  You must kick low and deep and do 
the shadow uppercut as fast as possible, otherwise it will be to late to 
connect.  This is easier when close to the corner.

     o     Jump Kick - Low Bolt:  Jump kick your opponent low and 
immediately do the low green bolt.  After starting the jump kick, keep 
the joystick in the away position, so you can quickly do the half-circle 
motion right after you hit.

     o     Ball Breaker - Turn Around Kick - Shadow Kick:  Do the ball 
breaker against your opponent.  Immediately jump over the groaning victim 
and kick them low as you turn to face the other direction.  Follow this 
with the shadow kick.

=======
REPTILE
=======

     o     Jump Kick - Acid Spit:  Jump kick your opponent low and 
immediately do the acid spit.  Start the two forward motion right before 
you hit, then quickly press HIGH PUNCH.

     o     Forcball - Two Punches - Hop Kick - Slide:  Do the forceball 
move on your opponent.  If they get hit by it, do two high punches as 
they are coming towards you.  After the punches do a hop kick.  You need 
to be in the right place for the high punches to connect.  After the kick 
complete the combo with the slide.

========
SUB-ZERO
========

     o     Jump Kick - Slide:  Jump kick your opponent low and 
immediately do the slide.  If you do not kick low and deep enough, the 
slide may not connect on human opponents.  It almost always works against 
the computer though.

     o     Jump Kick - Hop Kick - Slide:  Jump kick your opponent low and 
immediately do a hop kick, followed by the slide.  Easiest when your 
opponent is frozen.

===========
SHANG TSUNG
===========

     o     Flaming Skulls:  If you can catch your opponent in the air 
with the first one, there is a good chance that the other two will hit.  
Do the three skulls before your opponent jumps towards or away from you.

     o     Jump Kick - Flaming Skull:  Jump kick your opponent low and 
immediately do one flaming skull.  Start the two back motion right before 
you kick, then press HIGH PUNCH.  This one is hard as Shang Tsungs 
fireball travels slow.  More than one flaming skull after the jump kick 
is possible, although extremely difficult.

======
KITANA
======

     o     Jump Kick - Fan Throw:  Jump kick your opponent low and 
immediately do the fan throw.  Start the two forward motion right before 
you kick, then press both punch buttons.  If you are fighting the 
computer and they block your jump kick, the fan throw will usually hit.

     o     Jump Kick - Fan Throw - Hop Kick:  Jump kick your opponent low 
and immediately do the fan throw.  Start the two forward motion right 
before you kick, then press both punch buttons.  If you connect on the 
first jump kick and get the fan out fast, you can also hop kick your 
opponent as the are falling down.

JADE
====

Jade is the female ninja that can be seen in The Living Forest stage.  If 
the correct requirements are fulfilled, you will be transported through 
the Portal to Goro's Lair where you will fight Jade.  She is a green 
Kitana who walks twice as fast as her blue counterpart.  Requirements:

     o     Win ten matches in a row against the computer, starting at the 
begining.  It doesn't matter if you lose a round or not, just as long as 
you have ten wins on the stage before the question mark.

     o     Defeat the opponent on the stage before the question mark 
using only the BLOCK and LOW KICK buttons.  A flawless round is not 
necessary, neither is a fatality.  If you lose the first round you can 
still reach Jade by winning the second.
