                                  ==========
  1.6MB IBM PC Disk formatter. (C) 1992 Quazar. V1.1 update/20th April 1992


This  program  creates  a 1.6MB formatted HD disk, suitable for Super Magicom,
Super  Magic  Drive  &  Magic  Super  Griffin  backup  devices, or just normal
everyday DOS usage.


Usage:

New  for V1.1:  Upon running the command FORM16, you will be asked if you wish
to  verify  your  formatting.   If you choose NO, then your formatting will be
considerably faster than without verify.

Warning:   There  is no way of telling if your disk has successfully formatted
without  this option - so only use on trusted media, and at your own risk!  Do
you want your best console game to go onto a unverified disk?!!!

You will then be asked which drive (A or B) you would like to format, and then
to confirm you are ready to begin, or abort.

After the disk is formatted and checked, you will be asked to enter a name for
the disk.  This can be a maximum of 11 characters.

Finally,  you  will be asked if you would like to format another disk, or quit
the  program.   Formatting  will  commence on the same drive as you originally
selected.   If you would like to change to a different drive, quit the program
and begin again.

New for V1.1:  If at any prompt through the program you type QUIT, the program
will exit immediately.

**Remember  to  run  16READ.COM  in  your AUTOEXEC.BAT, to ensure that you can
read/write the 1.6MB disks after re-booting**

Note:   The  command  FDATA.COM  is  the actual module that FORM16.COM uses to
format  the  disks,  but  cannot  be  run directly.  The idea of this 'module'
format  is  so  that future updates can be integrated within the main program,
for example, future disk formats (2MB) etc..

Other new features for V1.1:

Extra error checking...

Version  1.1  of  Form16 now incorporates enhanced error checking, which means
any error that occurs during the usage of the program will now return an error
code.  If you get one of these errors then leave a message to either Quazar or
Executioner on the boards mentioned below.

If  you get an "Out of Memory" error, first reset the computer and re-try.  If
you continue to have this problem then quit all TSR programs running in memory
and try again.
