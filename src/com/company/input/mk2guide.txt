This guide is my own account of how to beat the computer playing as Shang 
Tsung, the strategies should work for all characters (except the ones with 
straight legs... like Liu Kang, Kung Lao). 
 
I also assume as you are playing on the right hand Joystick.....why? Well in 
case you hadn't noticed, when you play on the left hand-side the computer is 
very difficult to beat.  Try and jump into Baraka or Kitana and you will see 
they will always get you.  Try the  same on the other side and you will see 
you can always get them. 
  
To play on the right hand side just press the 2P start button at the 
beginning of your game.

I will also assume that the game is set on normal to very difficult. 
 
 

1. How to Beat the First Computer Opponent 
========================================== 
ON EASY - NORMAL ONLY: 

Whoever it is, it  can be beaten very easily.  For the first guy just Jump 
Kick, then sweep and then crouch and Block and then wait for him to come 
close to you. Then when he walks towards you  he won't throw you he will 
just start punching the air.  You just  push the joystick down and then 
press HP.  This will uppercut him.   Repeat this as he doesn't get any 
smarter. You can do this both rounds and get a Double Flawless.  This 
doesn't work if the game is set on very difficult, In which case look up the 
character further down.
 
 
2. How to Beat the Second Computer Opponent 
============================================ 
ON EASY - NORMAL ONLY: 

The Second Guy is slightly smarter,  he throws.  So you have to jump into 
him straight away and do the jump kick deep into its stomach.  This will hit 
it follow it up with a sweep.  Jump in again, before it gets back up and then 
jump kick, sweep, sweep,  move back 2 steps, sweep, move back 1 step, sweep.  
Jump back and  repeat from the jump kick.    
 
3. How to beat Liu Kang 
======================= 
  
Block straight away don't attempt attack him as he will either bicycle  kick 
you/Fly Kick.  In which case sweep him as he rebounds off you.   If he does a 
fly kick then block it and give him an uppercut. Or he may fireball you, If 
he does then you can't do much.....just block. 

Anticipate-kick Method 
======================

(It works on all the opponents that use a missile weapon that travels  
straight and at medium speed, e.g. Sub-Zero, Raiden, Reptile)  Once the 
computer is a jump distance away.   Walk forward and now jump towards him 
and aim your jump to land right in front of him (Forehead), but not touching 
him [About 2cm Away] and press  Kick.   (When you reach the point shown on 
the diagram) More likely than not  he will jump backwards to avoid your kick.  
Wham! It will hit him as he tries to jump back.  It will knock back quite far 
you may be able to sweep him. So repeat the method and get back into position. 
(Done correctly you can get flawless without using any button other then 
LK... hence useful for getting Jade)

4. How To Beat Kung Lao 
======================= 
 
At the start of the round bend down and get ready for him to teleport, then 
uppercut him.

You can use the fireball method if you are low on energy.  Jump back into   
any corner and then do two fireballs. Keep on doing two fireballs.  Lao will 
teleport into your fireballs at exactly the sweep distance.  Continue  to do 
this method on both rounds.

   \Edge of screen. 
 
 
If you don't want to do this method for some reason.  Then at the start of  
the round jump kick.... prematurely.  It should hit him.  If it doesn't then 
he should block and fire his hat at you.  Block it and Uppercut him or  
roundhouse kick him.  Jump towards him and do the same again.  Sweep if he  
lands near  then uppercut him. 
 
With Raiden you can do the body launch into him repeatedly.  He always  
misses you.

 
5. How to Beat Johnny Cage 
========================== 
 
At the start bend down and get ready to uppercut him.  He will most of the 
time shadow kick or jump towards you, in which case uppercut him. Now when 
you are about reptiles tongue fatality distance, jump towards  him and do a 
deep jump kick (That's the one where you  aim for his bottom  part of the 
body), It should get him as he will try to firebolt you.   If it doesn't then 
press block straight away, he will  80% of the time firebolt you,  block this 
and then stand up and press HK (You  should be next to him by now).  This 
will knock him backwards.  Don't try to uppercut him as he will throw you.  
Repeat this process from the  deep jump kick and blocking. Make sure you jump 
backwards to get the right  distance. 
 
 
6. How to Beat Reptile 
====================== 
 

The method I recommend is at the start of the round jump towards  him and do 
a jump kick slightly early.  He will either try to go invisible  in which 
case it will hit him and turn him visible or he will spit at you,  In which 
case you should get him and then follow it up with a sweep. Or  he will jump 
kick you, if you did your jump kick before his it will get him.  Now the hard 
part.  The only method that I find works on him very well is the anticipate 
jump kick method. Anticipate at the same distance as Liu Kang and it should 
get him.  If he doesn't jump back then he is going to  spit at you, the 
anticipate method if done correctly should land you in front  of him and when 
he spits block it and sweep straight away.... otherwise  he will jump back.  
You can also go for deep jump kicking, like Cage.
 
 
7. How to Beat Sub-Zero 
======================= 
 

Jump kick towards him and he will either jump kick you or freeze you,  If he 
tries to freeze you then block and give him a fast uppercut.  You can after 
he has landed do your projectile, but you have to be fast. Sometimes you can 
do a deep jump kick into him and then sweep him.  If he's hard as he is just 
before the question mark then I recommend using  the anticipate jump kick 
method.
 

8. How to Beat Kitana 
===================== 
 
Kitana is fairly easy to beat as she fires her missiles alot.  Jump straight  
into her, as soon as you start the level.  She will either jump kick you  or 
she will more often than not, throw her fans.  Your kick should hit her,  
sweep after it hits her. Now dont jump into her if she is one of the last  
characters left to fight, as she will do her fan lift on you. Wait until she  
gets up and Jump back and walk back for 2 secs, now you can jump into her  
and do a jump kick.  She will block it and throw her fan. You give her an  
uppercut and (If in range) sweep. Jump kick again and block her fan throw,  
then give her  an uppercut.  If at anytime she starts to punch you 
repeatedly,  block and after the third punch do your sweep fast... that 
should get her.     
 
 
9. How to Beat Jax 
=================== 
 
Jump kick him early, and if it hits him sweep otherwise block and get  ready 
for his energy wave.  After the energy wave hits your body, uppercut  him, if 
he lands close sweep him once.  If he lands outside sweeping   distance you 
can be abit risky and fire three fireballs (Not really   recommended if you 
have little energy or he if near the end of the list).   He does the energy 
wave alot and if your uppercuts arent getting him as  he keeps throwing you 
every time you try, then wait for his energy wave and  then sweep and walk 
back two steps, jump back once.  Jump forward towards  him and get ready for 
an energy wave. Repeat this procedure. 
 
NB: If you are using Jax then you can on all the characters (Except Kintaro  
and Shao Khan) deep jump kick them and then backbreaker. Before they get up  
walk back and then jump once, get ready for the computer to jump into you  
again.  When it does, do the jump kick and then backbreaker combo.  Repeat  
from  the walking back process.


10. How to Beat Mileena 
======================= 
 
She can be quite difficult at times, if she is further up the list.   If you 
want you can either jump kick towards her and hope she does fires   her sais 
and then sweep her or you can jump back and block and hope  she does her drop 
kick and then jump-kick her. The only method that I have   discovered that 
works against her is where you do a jump kick real early  and aim it so that 
her heads hits the center of your leg...... she will  fire her sais, block 
them and stand up and press HK.   Walk back two steps and then  jump back. If 
you don't do this she will  kick you as you jump back.  She will often do the 
ground roll,  keep on trying for the jump kick method.  If you hit her while 
you do the jump kick, follow it with a sweep. 
 
 
11.  How to Beat Baraka 
======================= 
 
Jump kick towards him fairly early as he will fire his bolt, and then  follow 
it up with a sweep as it will hit him.  Walk back two steps and then   jump 
back. Jump towards him, Jump kick and sweep.If he blocks then jump backwards, 
he will  jump towards you so you jump towards and sweep him.  This is the 
simple strategy you use for him, repeat the process from the deep jump kick. 


You can also repeatedly sweep through the whole round and every time he fire 
his bolt, he will get hit.  Keep sweeping, you should win.
 
 
12. How to Beat Scorpion 
======================== 
 
Jump kick towards him straight away, as he will most likely throw his  spear, 
and then sweep.  Now jump back and wait for him to fire his  spear, now once 
he has fired the spear, if you are close, uppercut  him and then jump kick 
towards him and sweep.  This will get him most of   the time.  The basic 
strategy for this bloke is jump kick and wait to  uppercut him and then 
sweep. If you are desperate then go for the  anticipate-jump kick method. 
 
 
13. How to Beat Raiden 
====================== 
 
The fireball in the corner works on Raiden, not as good as Kung Lao  but if 
you time it right it works the same.  The main  method I use  is the 
Anticipate jump kick,  mostly.  The anticipate jump kick method is   way I 
beat him every time.  You can also deep jump kick him and then sweep.
 

14. How to Beat Shang Tsung 
========================== 
 
I will assume he hasn't Morphed into anyone ..... if he has then  beat them 
using the method described.  I figured this guy works  slightly different 
then the other characters as he has very good  defenses.  Now start the round 
towards  him with a jump kick  as usual.  He should block it.  Now he will 
follow it up with one   fireball, block this fireball and dont sweep him or 
uppercut him as he will always throw you, before you can do anything. Instead 
after you have blocked his fireball jump backwards and when you land get 
ready for him to jump towards you.  When he does jump towards him and do a 
jump kick and then sweep. I prefer uppercut and then 3 fireballs.  You can if 
you want to fight him jump towards him and jump kick him deep  so it hits his 
belt.  He should fireball you as you are about to kick  him.  You will see 
the fireball fly past.... and your jump kick should  hit him, now follow it 
up with a sweep. 
 
 
NB:-  When you are in the corner and they are attacking you, bend down  and 
sweep them.... they will throw you, now jump back. As this is the   only way 
if I have found out to get out of the corner... you have to  sacrifice  this 
energy as they will walk towards you  and throw you 3  times, if you dont or 
jump kick you.  


15.  How to Beat Kintaro 
======================== 
 
Morph to Kitana and do the fan lift in the corner and then fan throw and 
uppercut.  If you morph back to yourself fire three fireballs.  If he starts  
to jump in the air then jump back at the peak of your  jump and press HK. If 
he is at the other end of the screen then fire 3 fireballs but watch out  he 
may spit his fireballs.  You can do your missile attack at him in the  air 
and aim for his head. 

If you are using another character other than Shang, then take him to one 
side of the screen and then sweep him, jump back, sweep him again etc.  Until 
he makes a mistake, when he raises his chest up, Uppercut him.  If you sweep 
too early he will spit a fireball at you and it will get you,  so make sure 
your sweeps are timed.    

When he tries to stomp you, you can uppercut him as he tries to stamp on you.  
Timing is critical.


 
16.  How to Beat Shao Khan 
========================== 
 
The method I use is double buffering the two fireballs.  I wait for him  to 
point his finger and I am at the opposite side of the screen.  I then   fire 
two fireballs and quickly fire another two.  As soon as the fireballs  hit 
him I fire the other two, this way he doesn't have a chance to   retaliate as 
he keeps trying to fire his spear at you. This way you can  get double 
flawless on him. 

Or if you aren't using Shang Tsung, Bend down and block in the corner and  
wait for him to do his shoulder charge, When he rebounds off, Uppercut  and 
then fire your projectile. Repeat until hes dead. If he points his finger at 
you, execute a special move.
