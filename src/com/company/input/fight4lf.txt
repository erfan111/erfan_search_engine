///The Unofficial Fight For Life FAQ v. 0.9

Q. What is Fight For Life?

A. Quite simply, Fight For Life (FFL) is Atari's answer to Sega's arcade
hit Virtua Fighter (VF). But Atari has one-up'ed Sega. FFL is a 3D polygon
based fighting game, but instead of using flat shaded polygons like VF, it
will use texture mapping on those polygons to enhance the look of the
characters and surroundings. FFL also has fast moving, variable "camera"
views to better capture the fast paced action. It will be on a 4 MegaByte
cartridge. 

*************************************************************
Q. Who is Developing Fight For Life?

A. FFL is Atari's project, but they have managed to hire Francois Bertrand
(from Sega's AM2 programming team that developed Virtua Fighter and Virtua
Racing) to code it for them. Atari then turned to an outside developer
based in a suburb of Chicago to do the artwork for this project. 

*************************************************************
Q. What is the plot of Fight for Life?

A. Missing in action, killed in a bar fight or by a crazy psychiatrist.
Life after life can be a nightmare, especially if your real life has been a
mess. In Hell, there is just one way back... the annual Hell Fighting
Tournament. If you win, you have a chance to fight against the son of the
Devil himself. It's not really a pleasure, but the prize for victory here
is a life, a new life. Welcome to Fight for Life...

manager had made upon this fight. His reputation ruined, M.J. furiously
stode out to a city bar, proceeded to get into a barroom brawl and was
killed by the patrons. Some people believe it was all a setup by the mob,
