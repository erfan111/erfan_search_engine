What's New 
-----------------------

This section of the FAQ is exactly what its name says.  It's a summary of some of the changes to this updated version of the FAQ in a quick reference way so you to know what to look for as you peruse the guide.  

Changes from 3.1:
Names of Fighting Styles added.
Playing as Dural.
Jeffry's Body Press corrected (Was Back, Back+Punch; Now Back+Punch only)
Two player games with the same colored characters.
Sarah's Knee & Rising Knee combo added.

Additions from 3.0:
A strategy section for kicking opponents in the back of the head
Short Hopping Jab and Karate Chops for all characters
Akira & Pai -- Repeated Ground Punches
Kage -- Hopping Jab/Sweep Combo
Color coding of Difficulty Settings
A rumor has also surfaced about VF2 being field tested in Japan.  (Always take rumors with a grain of salt, though....)

Additions from 2.7:
Jeffry -- Knee/Rushing Uppercuts Combo

Changes from 2.7:
Headers revised to be (hopefully) more readable

Additions from 2.6:

The character strategy guide has been edited and altered to reflect new moves and info.

The Virtua Fighter complete guide is now the largest FAQ for a single video game on the internet!  Congratulations guys on all the moves/strategies/things to talk about we've gotten started for this great game.

Enjoy the guide.

Definitions 
-----------------------

vir tu a (ver'chu a), slang for virtual 

vir tu al (ver'chu al), adj. for all practical purposes, actual, real fighter (fi'ter), n. 1) a person or thing that fights 2) a person who participates in a violent struggle; combat or conflict; battle; contest

vir tu a  fight er (ver'chu a  fi'ter),n. 1) a person who, for all practical purposes is actually participating in a real battle or contest 2) One of the baddest one on one fighting  games to hit the streets whose breathtaking polygon graphics and genuine martial arts moves are sure to captivate players all across the globe

-----------------------
Introduction 
-----------------------

Different is good.

Lately, gamers have been hit pretty hard by a barrage of fighting games ranging from those whose only draw is blood and guts to those who resemble a sick horse that should be humanely shot or at least taken to a hospital for a few years....

With the release of their first ever fighting game1 , Sega has broken new ground by designing the only current martial arts game whose draw isn't violence or the ever popular 'magic' moves, but whose draw is realism, fluidity of motion, and genuine martial art techniques. 

The ability to so successfully meet these goals is due to Sega's System 1 polygon graphics engine which is much like the system  used in their popular Virtua Racer.  This system can handle over 180,000 flat shaded polygons per second, and since the fighters are three-dimensional figures made of polygons instead of just flat images, be prepared to be dazzled by more than just the backgrounds.

As for the game itself, Virtua Fighter plays like other recent fighting games in some respects.  There are 8 characters to choose from, and the basic object of the game is to, through the use of punches, kicks, throws, grabs, pounces, and a variety of other techniques, drain your opponent's life meter. The problem is that at this point Virtua Fighter already shows its differences from other fighting games because you can also win by knocking your opponent out of the ring.  Another difference is that Virtua Fighter has many more special moves than any previous fighting game; there are over 100 secret techniques to discover.  Not to mention that it just feels more like a real battle due to the fluid motion and realistic moves. 

Needless to say, Virtua Fighter is destined to be remembered as both a great one on one martial arts game and a spectacular fighting simulator.  If you haven't seen one yet, then go check it out at your local arcade.

Otherwise, check out the moves and strategies in this FAQ and then use them to help you master this exciting game before someone else gets ahead of you.

-----------------------
Getting Started 
-----------------------

-----------------------------
FIRST - How to win the match 
-----------------------------


The winner is the first player to win 3 sets. 

NOTE: Virtua Fighter can be adjusted so that the winner wins after winning 2, 3, 4, or 5 sets.  On 2, the winner must win 2 out of 3 sets.  On 3, he must win 3 out of 5, and so on.  Factory setting is two sets, but this goes much too fast.  Four or five is much too long.  Three sets is where the game plays best for the gamer and still earns well for the operator.  If your Virtua Fighter is not put on 3 sets, talk to your local arcade manager about having him do so, for it only takes a few seconds to change over. 


-----------------------------
SECOND- How to win a set 
-----------------------------

1)	By KO
2)	By a 'Ring Out'
3)	By a 'Time Out'

KO- so thoroughly pulverizing your opponent that you completely drain his life meter

Ring Out- somehow or other knocking your opponent out of the 'ring' that you are fighting in

Time Out- each round lasts only 30 seconds, so if you are ahead, it might be to your advantage to just let the last few seconds tick away, and win by decision


-----------------------------
THIRD- Terminology 
-----------------------------

Term     Meaning             As in
----------------------------------
VF       Virtua Fighter      The game this FAQ is about

-----------------------------
FOURTH- The buttons 
-----------------------------

WHEN YOU ARE STANDING

PUNCH - Steps forward with a punch
        Repeat for multiple punches

KICK -  A kick to the head
        Not too powerful or effective

DEFEND- Blocks your opponent's STANDING and JUMPING attacks 
        You take no damage from such attacks. 
        Crouching attacks do damage.
        You are still pushed backwards
        Some special moves can be done while defending


WHEN YOU ARE CROUCHING:

PUNCH - Low punch; Hits standing defenders
        Stays in one place; quite weak and ineffective

KICK -  Low kick to the knee; very weak; Hits standing defenders
        Longer reach than a crouching punch, but slower

DEFEND - Defends against all crouching attacks, and ducks under many 
         standing attacks; some standing attacks and most jumping 
         attacks will still hit.

All moves that can be done while holding the defend button are marked with a {D}.
All moves that will hit a standing defender are marked with an {S}.
All moves that will hit a crouching defender are marked with a {C}.


-----------------------------
FIFTH- JUMPING 
-----------------------------

TYPES OF JUMPS

1) Long distance jump  Hold jump {D}


JUMPING ATTACKS

Name                 Motion
------------------------------------------
Hopping Karate Chop  Tap Jump and Punch {D}
Hopping Jab          Tap Jump, Tap Up+Punch in air {D}
Overhead hammer      Hold Jump, For+Pun {D}
Jumping kick         Hold Jump+Kick {D}
Hop kick             Tap Jump+Kick {D}
Drop Kick Forward    Hold Jump,For+Kick {D}
Drop Kick Behind     Hold Jump,Back+Kick {D}

Short jumping attacks work OK, but the punches & kicks come out in almost slow motion, and you can easily be knocked down by any attack from your opponent. 

Short jumping attacks are the only jumping attacks which can hit a crouching opponent.

Kage has two types of drop kicks, depending on distance.


COLLISION IN MID AIR

Will usually just push both players away from each other, & neither one will hit the other.


JUMPING WHILE BLOCKING

all jumping attacks can be done while holding defense
this can be especially helpful when doing an in close distance jumping kick


---------------------------------
SIXTH- Running and all that Jazz 
---------------------------------

Name                       Motion
-------------------------------------------------------
Step Forward Quickly       For, Tap For
Step Backward Quickly      Back, Back
Run Forward                For, Hold For
Turning around             Tap or hold towards opponent
Turn around punch or kick  Attack

NOTE: defense doesn't work when you are facing backwards


-----------------------------------------
SEVENTH- Crouching, Standing, and Throws 
-----------------------------------------

NOTE:   There is a real difference between "," and "+" in this FAQ.
Especially when in conjunction with a downward movement.  For example, "D+K" must be done as a tap to the joystick down and simultaneously pressing the K button.  On the other hand, a "D, K" could be done by tapping the joystick down and pressing K or also by holding the joystick down and then pressing the K button.

This is only most notably important in the snap kicks, backflips, and kickflips which require a tap of the joystick in conjunction with possibly pressing the button.

All throws assume that you are standing next to your opponent.  Some throws require that you're opponent be crouching.

ALL throws can be done to an opponent who is defending
SOME throws can be done while you are defending


-----------------------------
EIGHTH- Replays 
-----------------------------

At the end of every set, the computer will replay the last 3 seconds or so of the fight, and then the winner will do his victory pose.  This is a really cool feature, but may soon get irritating.  Sega, realizing the positive/negative aspects of such a feature, was smart enough to add a way to skip past the replay by simply hitting the START button.  This way, you can still watch the replays if you had an especially exciting finish, or you can just hit start and immediately go on to the next set.


Finally now, the moves...
