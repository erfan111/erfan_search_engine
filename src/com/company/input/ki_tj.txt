Rainbow Blood:
When playing another Tj.Combo, use this combo on your opponent 
Hold B,F,2,B,1,F,B,1 . Make sure that the roll hits three times 
Tj.Combo will lean and spit out some rainbow coloured blood.

Midair Ultra Combo:
You must be playing on any of the 3D or rooftop stages,back your opponent 
into the corner when their second energy bar is flashing red.Do the double 
backfist move then immediately do the ultra combo (hold F,B,3).The first
2 hits will connect and knock the opponent off the roof but then Tj.Combo
will do his ultra combo into midair hitting nothing ,the opponents body
will start rising ,their body will also be jolting and spewing blood as
if the combo were hitting normaly.

Easy Strategy To Beat Eyedol:

When playing against Eyedol at the start of the match jump back then 
just keep doing the straight knee (hold B,F,4) continually until he 
is dead,he will block most of them and take about every sixth one.
On the bridge background finish with a special move to knock him into the 
lava.

Finishing Moves Theory:

I'm sure most of you have heard the different button for each of the six 
finishing moves theory,but for those of you who hav'nt here it is.
There are six buttons and six finishing moves ie.

Button 1.  = Humiliation 
Button 2.  = Neck Break No Mercy                              
Button 3.  = Ultra Combo
Button 4.  = 
Button 5.  = Ultimate Combo
Button 6.  = Screen Smash No Mercy

Therefore button 4. must be for No Mercy 3. This theory checks out okay
on all the characters who's six finishing moves are known so why not on TJ.

Tj.Combo's Ending:

When he wins the Ultratech Tournament ,Combo finally achieves his ambition
to regain his lost fortune and popular status.Once a nobody from the ghetto
Tj.Combo celebrates his wins and newfound wealth by parading through those
same streets. With money and fame at his side ,Combo believes he can achieve
anything.
