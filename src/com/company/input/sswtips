Super Star Wars tips

From: TOMINATR@ac.dal.ca

Here's a little tip:

On the first level, kill all the scorpions that appear on the rock at the
very beginning of the level.  This will give you a weapon power-up.
A little further on in the level, there are these green monsters that
hop out at you.  Kill all of these guys and you will get another weapon
power-up.  This will make the first boss very easy.
BTw, there IS a level select cheat, but I sold my game and don't remember
the cheat.  This cheat also allows you to choose your weapon, character,
life level, and a few other things.

It's something like X,X,X,X,Y,B,B...  It's pretty long.  If you get no
responses, I could check through my EGMs and find it for you.

From: hartley@everest.ee.umn.edu (Tim Hartley) on beating the trench level:

Shoot the fireballs first; these are what damage you.  Shoot the tie-fighters
when convenient, like when passing between fireballs.  The most annoying thing
is if you don't get the end move right, firing down the chute, you must go
through the death-star surface level again.  My first time through
I just sat after getting through the ties and the boss;  it took me
forever to get through that again level.  I'm still not clear on what I was
supposed to shoot at to drop the bomb down the chute, but I shot randomly
and it let me through to the final cinema.  (fire your torpedos when Ben
says "Use the force luke", you may have to go through this twice, just
like the movie.  Brian)

BOSSES tips:

HOVERCRAFT at the end of the Mos Eisley part.

   Piece of cake.   For the hover craft make certain you have a large life
   bar (HUGE i'm talking). If you die the first time up against it then
   use chewy to defeat it. Chewy has a reasonable blaster and the longest
   life bar.  These are the steps:

   - slide under center of hovercraft and shoot out bottom gun turret (which
     should be above you now).  This is the only place where you should take
     significant damage.
   - shoot out the bottom left and right pieces of the the craft (lifters?
     thrusters?)
   - now you can select a position as far right as possible so that when
     the craft is far left as it goes, the top rigth gun turret can't hit you.
     Once in that position, your blaster should be able to hit it when
     pointed up and to the left.
   - Do the exact mirror image of the above to take out the top left
     turret the same way.
   - blast the craft to smitherings, it will now take damage.
