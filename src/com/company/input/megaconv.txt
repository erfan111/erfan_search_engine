      Converter for MegaDrive game files between MultiGameDoctor 2,
      Super Magic Drive and Raw binary data formats for AMIGA & PC

 Why MEGACONV?

  We had got our own custom built console copier for about an year
  now, but until lately, it has just been a storage device. We have
  not swapped games at all (In fact, until VPIRACY text files came
  out, we didn't know anyone else had such devices.) but as we found
  out that there was console areas in some boards, it was time to
  get active in this thing also. 

  Ok, we leeched a pile of megadrive game files, and noticed that
  those copiers have VERY strange ideas how 16bit data should be
  written to disk. Only MegaDrive has this problem, as it is only
  TRUE 16 bit console. SNES is 16/8 bit one, NEO GEO is another
  true 16 bit machine, but who trades those 6MB games?

  Our system stores MegaDrive data as 68000 raw binary 
  like Amiga stores its files. MGD2 stores as half of the file
  is LOW bytes and other half is HI bytes. SMD stores them
  in 16kb blocks (LOW/HI/LOW/HI) and also adds own 512byte
  long header.

  Beeki coded first little util that converted SuperMagicDrive
  stuff to RawBinary. Later, when we stumbled to one MGD2
  megadrive file, he added that also. After we heard that people
  around have this problem with formats also, we decided to do 
  a true multi format converter program. This crap was developed
  on an Amiga with some HD and 10MB ram using MANX C and later
  SAS C 5.10b. PC port over was done day later using Borland
  Turbo C on some 10mhz AT clone we had here.

 How to use MEGACONV?

  MegaConv v1.0 - SMD/MGD-2/Binary converter for MegaDrive game files 
  Coded by Beeki for IMAGE - Released on Feb 05 1992 
 
  Usage: MegaConv [-q[b|m|s]] <Source> -[b|m|s] [Destination]
  
     -q ... process indicator off
     -qq .. all process texts off
     -qqq . ALL texts off

     -b ... RawBinary
     -m ... Multi Game Doctor 2
     -s ... Super Magic Drive

  This should be enough to most of the users, but I will explain
  it carefully to those who didn't understand.
 
  Source and Destination file names are simple. In case you
  don't specify destination file name, it will be '<Source>.MD'
  for binary, '<Source>.SMD' for Super Magic Drive and 
  'MDx000.00x' for MultiGameDoctor 2, as this is the format how
  MGD2 creates the filenames itself. x means size in megabits.
  'MULTI-GD' directory file will also be created for MGD2. 
  This allows you just to insert MGD2 floppy to your MSDOS drive 
  and run this program while that disk is your current dir, and 
  program creates ALL files, you just then smash the disk to MGD2
  drive and you are ready to play.

  Conversion format will be specified before filename. You
  can add '-q', '-qq' or '-qqq' before source format to eliminate 
  process indicator, all process texts or ALL text output.
 
  If you don't specify source format, program will try
  to determine it from the extension of the file name. 
  If this fails, you will get an error message and you MUST 
  specify the format manually. If you don't specify destination
  format, it will be Raw Binary for SMD/MGD2 files, and MGD2 for
  Raw Binary files. 
  
  examples of use:

  >> MegaConv GAME.SMD 
  converts GAME.SMD (SuperMagicDrive) to GAME.MD (RawBinary)

  >> MegaConv -qqm MD8000.008 -s
  converts MD8000.008 (MGD2, 8Mbit) to MD8000.SMD (SuperMagicDrive)
  without any process texts.

  >> MegaConv -b GAME.MD -m
  converts GAME.MD (RawBinary) to MDx000.00x (MGD2, x = size in Mbits)  

  >> MegaConv -m MD4000.004 -s GAME.SMD
  converts MD4000.004 (MGD2, 4Mbit) to GAME.SMD (SuperMagicDrive)

  >> MegaConv -qs GAME.SMD -b GAME.MD
  converts GAME.SMD (SuperMagicDrive) to GAME.MD (RawBinary)
  without process indicator.

  >> MegaConv -qqq GAME.MD
  converts GAME.MD (RawBinary) to MDx000.00x (MGD2, x=size in Mbits)
  without ANY text output

  This should be enough. Test it a bit and you'll get the idea.

 Further development

  We are planning to support ALL imaginable formats on ALL consoles.
  So if you have any file for any console in any format that is
  uncompatible some other copier format, drop us one file in both
  formats, and we code a convert routine to this program.
  We have currently files for Mega Drive in SMD and MGD2 formats,
  for Super Famicom in MGD2 format and PC Engine in Super Twin
  and MGD2 formats. Any other copier format files are more than
  welcome.
  Our own copier has adapters to MegaDrive, SuperFamicom, PC Engine,
  Game Boy, Game Gear, Sega Master System and Lynx(!)
  We have also systems for Atari 2600, Colecovision and Mattel
  consoles, but is there anyone out there who has such machine?
  Remeber: our own system is custom built prototype, and we 
  can't sell you one, no matter how much you would want one. 

 Hardware stuff

  Our hardware guys are interested to buy NES/Famicom (OLD 8 BIT
  NINTENDO) copier if there is ANY out there, So we can see
  how copier companies have solved few HARD problems in NES
  copier. This way we can add NES in our copier system also!  

  Also under planning is to start building a MEGA DRIVE copier for
  CHEAP price. Maybe even as a 'build-by-yourself' kit. 
  It will be using mega drive's 68000 to run the copier
  software, and PC floppy controller and drive for reading files.
  (so in theory we can also develop Hard Disk version!)
  Drop a line if you are interested. Planned target price for the
  device with 0K ram and no floppy controller&drive is about 250$
  and it uses normal SIMMs so 1MB configuration is only about 
  75$ more. 2MB configuration will also be supported.
  You can get normal PC floppy controller cards and 720k drives
  practically for FREE, so it gets VERY cheap!

 Bugs and how to contact us.

  There is no known bugs or unwanted features in this version. Both
  Amiga and PC versions are very little betatested, as we have
  little use for other conversion types than TO binary format. 
  Under beta tests it has NEVER failed to operate as planned.

  Murphy's law ofcourse says that it WILL fail, and probably on
  YOUR machine, so in case it fucks up, drop us a line! Also
  if you see another copier format and want it to be included 
  to this converter PLEASE send us one file in that format, we
  want to make it as complete as possible.

  You can contact us at the moment ONLY by dropping a message
  on Thunderdome or World of Mirage.
 
  Our own boards here in Finland don't have a console section yet.
  Night Shift BBS is down for 3-4 months at least, but as it
  opens, it will have a section. Possibly it will be CONSOLE
  ONLY board, but we'll see that... No Man's Land will stay
  as AMIGA ONLY because of too small HD and no console owned
  by SysOp.

  So drop us a line!
  Thunderdome ...... +1-408-263-9136 (to 'Jarnis/IMAGE')
  World of Mirage .. +1-718-898-8421 (to 'JARNIS IMAGE')
