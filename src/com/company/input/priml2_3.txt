Fighting games have recently swamped the arcades.  They range from really bad
animation and graphics to just a plain old copy of another game.  Primal Rage
changes that by having excellent graphics and unique characters.  But you
say,  "Who made this?  Those dudes that made Asteroids?"  Yup, that's them.
 They have released two games in 1994 and Primal Rage is one of them!  Using
what's called "Stop-Motion Animation," the graphics are intense. You are
given seven characters to choose from, ranging from prehistoric dinosaurs to
mythological creatures.  Atari has put a lot of work into it. Two years
worth!  The special moves system is also new and different (see Special
Moves).

Go see for yourself!

Primal Rage debuted at the 1994 CES in Chicago and was voted "Showstopper"
by Game Pro Magazine.

1.1 Storyline

	Before there were humans, gods walked the earth. They embodied the essence
of Hunger, Survival, Life, Death, Insanity, Decay, Good, and Evil. They
fought countless battles up through the Mesozoic Wars. Then Balsafas, an
archmage from a parallel dimension, anticipated the threat that Earth's gods
posed. He was not powerful enough to kill the gods, so instead he banished
one to a rocky tomb within the moon. This disrupted the fragile balance
between the gods; pandemonium ensued, and a great explosion threw clouds of
volcanic dust into the atmosphere. The dinosaurs died out, and the surviving
gods went into suspended animation.
	Now, the impact of a huge meteor strikes the Earth. Its destructive force
wipes out civilization, rearranges the continents and frees the imprisioned
gods. Get ready to rumble...

1.2 Meet the Critters

ARMADON, god of Life 
Based on: Triceratops, Ankylosaurus, and Stegasaurus
Height: 17 feet
Length: 27 feet
Weight: 2.25 tons
Domain: the Hollows, a big underground chamber filled with stalactites and
stalagmites. There are plenty of cave openings with worshipers living in
them.

A big guy with lots of horns and spikes, Armadon is a slow mover and poor
jumper but has some of the easiest and most deadly combos in the game. Unlike
the other reptiles, he doesn't really "bite" but rather attacks with the horn
on his face. One of the easier characters to use against the CPU. His
original name was "Spike", but perhaps that was before the game designers saw
"The Land Before Time"... ^_^

BLIZZARD, god of Good
Based on: Gorilla/King Kong
Height: 20 feet
Weight: 1.8 tons
Domain: the Cliff, an icy and mountainous area. There's a temple in the cliff
to the right. The big mountain in the background has a faint pattern of an
ape face.

A big ape with powers of elemental cold and semi-invulnerable rushing punches
(sort of a de-evolved cross between Sub-Zero & Balrog :). His freezing
abilities are excellent for setting up killer combos. He can jump pretty
high, too, but lacks a Leaping Attack.

CHAOS, god of Decay
Based on: gorilla/Son of Kong 
Height: 17 feet
Weight: 1.1 tons
Domain: the Ruins, a strip of land near the wreckage of what was once a
metropolis. A river flows in the background, and a beached yacht lies to the
left.

Similar to Blizzard but smaller, Chaos is an ape prone to disgusting bodily
functions. His flatulent projectile is good for setting up combos, and his
air Ground Pound is great for cheezing the CPU. Though the PR gang in general
is quite vocal, Chaos is the only one who ever speaks a word - if he loses a
battle, he cries "No!" as he collapses.

DIABLO, god of Evil
Based on: Allosaur (a relative of T-rex)
Height: 17 feet
Length: 29 feet
Weight: 1.2 tons
Domain: The Inferno, a rocky volcanic island created by a geothermic upheaval
ten times as great as that which made the Hawaiian islands. Pyramids and
stone sculptures lie among the active   volcanoes and lava.

A small, striped, fire-breathing reptile with a big mouth and tiny foreclaws,
quick on his feet and an excellent jumper. His teleport and Torch moves help
compensate for his lack of a throw.

SAURON, god of Hunger
Based on: Tyrannosaurus Rex
Height: 20 feet
Length: 27 feet
Weight: 2.5 tons
Domain: the Cove, a sandy beach next to the ocean. A decaying Parthenon-like
temple lies in the background.

Sauron is similar to Diablo but larger; in fact, he's the biggest critter in
the game. He is somewhat slow (yet probably faster than real T-rexes ever
were :), a medium jumper, and dishes out major damage. His air-throw and air
Earthquake Stomp are excellent for cheezing the CPU. 

TALON, god of Survival
Based on: Deinonychus (a relative of Velociraptor)
Height: 16 feet
Length: 30 feet
Weight: 0.9 tons
Domain: the Strip, a grassy stretch of land dotted with trees. The number 49
is faintly visible in the ground at center screen. A waterfall splashes off
to the right.

The smallest and fastest critter in the game, Talon is a striped raptor. His
agility and excellent jumping ability compensate for his lack of projectiles.
His teeth are visible only on the front half of his mouth, and he has a large
upraised claw on the middle toe of each foot. (Deinonychi normally kept this
claw cocked so as not to interfere with moving about, but brought it down to
slash at their prey's belly). 
	Talon is the only critter who can flip during his jumps and the only reptile
who can attack with his front claws. He cannot attack with his tail
(Deinonychi tails were very stiff and probably used for balance instead). His
speed and high-priority air attacks make him one of the easiest characters to
use vs. human-controlled opponents. His biggest weaknesses are probably his
short range and the low damage rating of virtually all his attacks (on
version 2.3, at least).

VERTIGO, goddess of Insanity
Based on: king cobra, Sellosaurus (mistakenly named "Efraasia")
Height: 18 feet
Length: 48 feet
Weight: 1.3 tons
Domain: the Tomb, a grassy knoll with Stonehenge-style rock structures.
Images of Vertigo's petrified enemies are visible in the leftmost stones. A
full moon is in the sky.

The only female PR character, Vertigo has a body shaped somewhat like that of
a Sellosaurus (a young Sellosaurus was once mistakenly called "Efraasia",
hence the word in GamePro's articles & PR Strategy Guide). Like Sellosaurus,
she is a lightly built with legs longer than her forearms, and has a long
neck & tail. Unlike Sellosaurus, she has only two fingers on her front hands
(Sellosaurus had five) and the head & white-marked hood of a king cobra. She
does not cry out, but hisses loudly instead.
	Vertigo is one of the slowest and weakest (in terms of damage per attack) PR
characters, but her attacks possesses the longest reach. She can cast spells,
too; her unblockable "Voodoo Spell" helps make up for her lack of a regular
throw or leaping attack. Her lack of any basic or special anti-air move
outside of some jumping attacks is a significant liability. 

????, god of Death?
Based on: dragon skeleton?
Height: ?
Length: ?
Weight: ?
Domain: Dinosaur Graveyard [of the Final Battle]?

The next PR upgrade is rumored to add a new boss. Is he really a dracolich?
Will he be playable? Will he be a "he"? Will the chip ever show up? How many
games will I play with Riptor while I'm waiting for it? Nothing is known for
certain, everything is only speculation...

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-----------------
2.1  Normal Moves
-----------------

Primal Rage has only four buttons and a joystick.  The first column of
buttons are "Quick" attacks.  The second are "Fierce."  Both Quick or both
Fierce buttons pressed together are an extra-powerful "Strong" attack [just
like the AB and CD attacks in Samurai Shodown].

In addition to ASCII representations, the buttons will be referred to as
1=High Quick, 2=High Fierce, 3=Low Quick, 4=Low Fierce. A "+" signifies that
two buttons are pressed together; for example, "1+2" indicates that both the
High Quick and the High Fierce buttons are pressed at the same time.

Player 1 side joystick and button configuration:

      Up-Away  Up   Up-Toward              Strong
         (UA)  (U)   (UT)                  ___|___
           O    O    O                    |       |
            \   |   /                   Quick  Fierce

Away (A) O--         --O Toward (T)       O       O

            /   |   \                     O       O
           O    O    O
    Down-Away  Down  Down-Toward
      (DA)     (D)      (DT)

"Standing" means that the character is standing normally during the move
(joystick is neutral); "low" or "crouching" means that the character is
crouching during the move (joystick is held down).

Key:
O = button pressed
.. = button not pressed
U = Up
T = Toward
A = Away
D = Down
Full = Do a full circle
  Toward = full circle clockwise when facing right  (T-D-A-U)
  Away = full circle counterclockwise when facing right  (T-U-A-D)
  (think of a wheel rolling "away" or "toward" you're opponent)
? = Unknown


A hyphen (-) represents a fluid motion.  So you have to roll the joystick.
For example:
      D-T       is       |  \  --O      which is Sub-Zero's (MK) freeze
motion
                            O   O          or Ken's (SF) fireball motion.

Roll your joystick from the Down position to the Toward position.

All characters:
O . = Quick Bite   . O = Chomp   O O = Big Chomp
. .          	     . .                      . .

[or, 1=quick bite, 2=chomp, 1+2=big chomp]

. . = Quick Tail   . . = Tail    . . = Big Tail
O .         	   . O           O O

[3=quick tail, 4=tail, 3+4=big tail]

Move specific to Talon and the Apes (Chaos and Blizzard):
	|      . .   = Slide
           O   O O
[crouching 3+4. BTW the apes' "slide kick" is reminiscent of Cammy's
crouching Roundhouse or Nakoruru's crouching CD]

Talon also has a short slide which is:
        |    . .
        O    . O
[crouching 4]

-----------------
2.2 Special Moves
-----------------

   We'll be classifying special moves into eight types:  Projectiles, Leaping
Attacks, Throws, Stomps, Teleports, Anti-air, Anti-projectile and "generic"
attacks.  Projectiles & Teleports are self-explanatory and "generic attacks"
are basically "special" punches or kicks.  The rest require some explanation.
 Leaping attacks are guided jumps by the character in question, and if
unblocked (duh) they do damage.  Stomps are attacks in which the character
stomps the ground and tries to shake up his opponent.  These must be avoided
by blocking or jumping, or else they'll toss the opponent up into the air for
a beating!  
	Throws are special moves which cannot be blocked (although attempting to
throw a character in block-stun causes a cheeze warning -- see Misc. Info for
more on cheezy stuff!) and will be executed instantly if done right (so you
can get out of corner traps, etc.).  If you do it while your opponent is an
invalid target (in air, in block-stun, or too far away) your character will
go through a "missed throw" animation during which you may get pounded. You
can always jump to avoid being thrown or ticked, but if your opponent wasn't
trying to throw you after all then he can retaliate with an anti-air move!
	Anti-air moves work especially well against airborne opponents (particularly
since you cannot block in the air), but can also hit opponents on the ground.
Anti-air moves aren't necessarily 100% invulnerable to all air attacks, so be
careful! In general, your character's exposed back or hindquarters are a
vulnerable target. Anti-projectile moves are useful for bypassing a
projectile and attacking the enemy at the same time. Leaping attacks
technically fall into this category (if executed with *extremely* swift &
precise timing) but for practical purposes they're given their own class.
Throws that hit and a few other moves render you temporarily immune to
projectiles, but have an extremely short attacking range (and if you're that
close a smart opponent isn't likely to throw projectiles anyway). The other
anti-projectile moves usually have a limited or very specific invulnerability
area/period and attacking range; if you mis-time the move you'll run into the
projectile, and if the enemy's too far away you won't hit him and may be
suceptible to attack. 

   Despite Primal Rage's attempt to revolutionize the "special move" system
with a new, flexible system, the new version 2.3 upgrade allows you to
execute moves either through the proprietary PR style or through
"traditional" style button/joystick motion.  Probably due to a lot of "I
can't do the moves" (read the cabinet next time...!) from new players.  So
much for "onward and upward."

   The Primal Rage special move system works opposite the standard; to do a
special move, you press _and hold_ the appropriate buttons, execute the
joystick motion, only letting go of the buttons _after_ the joystick motion
(unless you like to stand still forever -- you can't move while doing special
moves except Talon's "run")  Some moves can only be done in this way
(Diablo's Torch, the Iron Maiden, and others) but...

   The upgrade contains new programming which allows you to execute joystick
motions, _then_ press the requisite buttons.  In some situations this has
caused accidental special moves, but in general it does make the special
moves more forgiving.  (tho' some would consider this bad... "oh, no, now
_anyone_ can freeze my butt?" :)

  All Special Moves listed work on a 2.3 machine (see Misc Stuff).

  *  indicates 'Finishing Move'
     NOTE1: These can be done from ANYWHERE but don't stand too close or
you'll hit your opponent while trying to hold down the buttons! For those
'two-part' fatalities (such as Vertigo's Petrify), hold the first two buttons
while you do the first set of joystick movements, then press the remaining
buttons WHILE STILL holding the first two buttons, and finish the remaining
joystick movements. 
    NOTE2: you must do the fatalities quickly or they won't work. Do not
pause between the halves of a two-part fatality. If you mess up, you can
typically re-enter the fatality at least once more before time runs out, so
keep trying and don't give up!
    Easy enough? ^_^

  ** indicates 'Chomp a human, get more life'

-----------------------------
2.3  Combos *** NEW INFO! ***
-----------------------------

   Yes, you can do some devastating combos in PR.  You can even volleyball
your opponent in the air!  Combos are easy to execute.  Any time you connect
with a hit (provided that there isn't much of a delay), you can hit a button
for a stronger attack which will commence immediately.  [Note: in a combo
that alternates between bites and tail attacks, you must tap the buttons
quickly. In a combo that chains bites together or chains tail attacks
together, you must tap the buttons even more quickly.] Special attacks are
considered "stronger" than the 1+2 or 3+4 ("power") attacks, so they may be
used to end any combination.  Or prolong it!  Combo hits can be done at any
time - whenever you hit an opponent, you can tack on another hit (unless
you're too far!) EVEN IN THE AIR!  You can get 2 or 3 hits in the air this
way, making for great combo starters (or enders!)

And there's a bonus! (two, actually!)

Thunder claps will happen if you do at least 4 hits _and_ a minimum of 35%
damage.  If you haven't seen it, the thunder and lightning are incredible.
 Especially when you're not expecting it. (but I guess you are now. =)  In
v2.3, you get as many claps as you got hits! (in 1.7 you could only get 10!).
[Note: Vertigo can get one clap of lightning in version 2.3 if she uses a
teleport in any combo.] Due to the decreased damages for attacks in v2.3, the
Thunder is less often seen, but IT IS THERE!  Finding combos that do more
than 35% damage is harder now than ever, though!

   Don't despair if you can't get a thunderbolt 'n' lightning (very very
frightening(ly!)) combo; there is a reward for using special moves in combos!
If you use certain moves in a combination, a "name" for the combo will be
printed out in the center of the screen!

   All of the named combos have three 'levels'.  The named combos are usually
activated by one special move.  There is also a minimum hit requirement.  One
named combo: If you use Sauron's Neck Throw in a combo which hits at least 4
times, you'll see "CRUNCHY".  If the combo hits at least 6 times, you'll see
"EXTRA CRUNCHY".  If the combo hits at least 7 times (a 9 hitter is possible
in the new version) you'll see "TAKE A BITE OUTTA CRIME!".  So the combo
naming scheme goes something like that - the first level is "NAME", the
second level is usually "SUPER NAME" or some modifier, and the third level is
a weird variation on the first two, with an exclamation "!" or question "?"
mark at the end (one has ". . .").

Key:
(1) (2)   Numbers are for which buttons are being pressed.
(3) (4)

The words 'in air' in parentheses (in air) means to hit the buttons while you
are still in the air.

   Combo names may be listed with combos, or separately.  Hopefully
eventually the criteria to get each combo name will be listed with each name,
for now the names will be stuck to the combo they came with, or with none at
all if someone just said "Talon can do the DELICIOUS combo!"

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ 3.  Brain Gauge+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Under your health bar (the big artery extending from your heart) is your
Brain Gauge.  Each time you take or block a hit, your brain gauge goes down.
If your brain gauge ever reaches "empty" when you get hit (while _not_
blocking) you will become stunned.  You can't get stunned while blocking, but
you can still be taken to "empty" brain, allowing a quick stun with few
successful hits thereafter.

   Brain power regenerates quickly; as long as you don't get hit for a while
you will soon be fine.  However, if you _do_ become stunned, shake the
joystick left and right (nothing else will help!) to regain your brain
faster. Once it reaches "full" again you will return to normal.  This also
works for "auto stuns" such as Blizzard's Punching Bag and freezes, Vertigo's
Voodoo Spell and Come Slither, or Chaos' FoFury.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
++++++++++++++++++++++++++ 4.  Offense and Defense++++++++++++++++++++++++++
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

------------
4.1  Offense 
------------

   Mix it up!  Using attacks that require the opponent to block low and high
alternately can be very disturbing (not to mention frustrating!), so know
which attacks must be blocked high and which low! (same goes for being on
defense -- see that section for more details)  The old "leaping attacks" can
now be blocked with standing blocks (just press away!), although your
recovery time from the block is seriously long, so the only bad result of
doing a leaping attack is being vulnerable in the air (tho you do also land
close to your opponent, so if you're a distance fighter...). The exception is
Talon's Brain Basher - it's possible for an opponent like Armadon to block it
and then uppercut him with a low 1+2.

   Remember that nearly all blocked basic or special attacks _do damage_ to
your opponent.  Unlike most other games, this damage is indeed significant,
and will tip any close match. Block damage can be used to beat reclusive
opponents, human or CPU, if you can sustain an assault for long enough.  Just
do "dink" damage for the entire round and when the clock runs out and the
other guy has no health left...

------------
4.2  Defense
------------

4.2.1 Blocking

   Blocking in Primal Rage starts off simple:  to block a high attack, pull
directly away from your opponent on the joystick.  To block a low attack,
pull down and away on the joystick.  If you get hit once, and someone starts
to unleash a combo, you can't block it.  That's why it's called a combo! So,
the moral of the story is...don't get hit! ^_^ On the other hand, sometimes a
human player or even the CPU will slip up and accidentally pause in the
middle of a combo, unintentionally ending it early and giving you a chance to
block their next attack..

   New in version 2.3 is block damage.  Well, not entirely new, but now
almost all basic & special blocked attacks do significant "tick" damage to
the blocker, and do slight damage to the brain gauge.  However, you can no
longer die from taking block damage, no matter how little health you have
left!  Turtle up! [Note: there seems to be an exception for Armadon's Iron
Maiden. If the block damage of that move precisely equals the amount of
health left, then sometimes blocking it can be fatal...? Armadon's opponent
doesn't go *crunch*, but falls over and dies...? Has anyone else experienced
this?]

Block these attacks high [the ground-based basic attacks usually involve a
descending overhead strike]:

1) Armadon's crouching 3 or 4 [I think!]
2) Blizzard and Chaos' standing 3+4, and Chaos' standing 4, [Blizzard's
standing 1+2?]
3) Talon's Standing 1+2
4) Vertigo's crouching 3 or 4

and 

5) Diablo's Pulverizer, Talon's Brain Basher [and other leaping attacks...?]
6) Air attacks - of course :)  Be extra careful on combo'd air attacks -- you
have to block both hits high!

Block these low:
1) All characters' low 3+4
2) Most characters' low 3 and low 4, except Armadon's & Vertigo's
3) Stomps (Sauron's Earthquake Stomp and Chaos' Ground Shaker)
4) Diablo's Hot Foot

Beware cross-up air attacks, which hit you so far behind that you must push
the joystick forward to block! Each character has a center of mass located at
about the abdomen. If an attack hits you in front of your center of mass, you
can defend normally. If it hits behind your center of mass, you must hold
your joystick in the opposite direction instead.
	Armadon's Spinning Death is another example. If Armie times it precisely as
you get up, he'll be spinning behind your center of mass - you must hold the
joystick in the opposite direction you'd otherwise hold it, or you will get
hurt. The 2.3 CPU Armadon does this every once in a while.

4.2.2 Avoiding Projectiles

Jumping to avoid projectiles can be hazardous to your health. If you take off
with a long jump or leaping attack as soon as your opponent begins to fire,
you might be able to score a hit, but then again you might not clear the
projectile and/or jump straight into an anti-air attack. The reptiles in
particular are vulnerable to projectiles underneath them if they do a jumping
bite [jumping tail attacks are safer for them] - for example, if Vertigo does
a jumping bite, rendering her body horizontal way above Blizzard's Cold
Breath, she'll get frozen anyway. So, what do you do when you opponent
think's he's Ryu? Four possible options...

1)  Some parts of some moves are invulnerable to some attacks (sometimes :).
Moves such as Chaos' FoFury, Diablo's Torch, Sauron's Primal Scream, Talon's
Slasher (a.k.a. "Double Slash") will allow projectiles to pass through or
over your character without hitting you. Teleports will let you avoid the
projectile completely. And then there's the anti-projectile moves...

2)  Depending on who you are, you can just fire a projectile to cancel your
 opponent's projectile.  Some projectiles pass through some other
projectiles, though, so be warned!

3)  If your projectile doesn't cancel the opponent's projectile and you still
have some time, you can fire another projectile.  The second projectile will
cancel your opponent's projectile!  Diablo vs. Chaos is a good example.  This
hasn't been tested on everyone, so it might not work for some!

4) Some characters are can duck underneath some projectiles. For example,
Vertigo can duck completely under Blizzard's Cold Breath if you hold the
joystick straight down (not down&back), while Diablo & several others can
duck completely underneath Sauron's Stun Roar if they crouch or block low. On
the other hand, no one can duck underneath Armadon's Flying Spikes. Some
character's basic attacks (such as Vertigo's crouching bites and, given the
correct timing, Talon's crouching slide kicks) are low enough that they'll
hit a nearby projectile thrower without trading damage.

------------------------------
4.3  Jumping *** new info! *** 
------------------------------

   There are three types of jumps in Primal Rage that can be done by any
characters.  First, to do a standard jump, just press up or diagonally up.
Pretty easy, eh?  The second type of jump is the long jump.  To do a long
jump, tap down, then do a "normal" jump immediately afterward.  This jump
will be higher and faster than the standard jump, and it will go much
farther. No more characters whose only jump is a drifter...  The third type
of jump is the most difficult, and most surprising jump in any game.  It is a
"hop jump" and you do it by pushing the direction you want to jump (T or A),
then down, then do the standard jump (i.e. T, D, UT, or A, D, UA).
 Additionally, the "hop jump" can now be done straight up, just tap forward
(or backward), down, and straight up!  Finally, unlike in Primal Rage v1.7,
you can execute Hop Jumps during matches with the computer (and the computer
can use them against you, too!) so your strategy will not have to change
quite as drastically.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
-----
4.4 Total Domination, Quick Kill, & Scoring *new info for version 2.3*
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
------

4.4.1 Total Domination

In version 2.3, winning a "perfect" battle (i.e. without losing *any* health,
not even block-damage from basic moves) is acknowledged as a "TOTAL
DOMINATION." These are not always as hard to get as one might think,
especially in certain matches vs the CPU (try repeatedly using Sauron's air 3
and/or air throw on CPU Diablo).

4.4.2 Quick Kill

A normal PR round lasts for 60 seconds. On version 2.3, destroying your
opponent with 50 or more seconds remaining on the timer merits a "QUICK KILL"
award. This is *much* harder to get than a TOTAL DOMINATION, though not
impossible (try swiftly & repeatedly using Diablo's standing 1+2 on CPU
Armadon, or stunning CPU Blizzard with five of Vertigo's standing 3+4s,
teleporting next to him, and finishing him off with a lethal combo). 

4.4.3 Scoring

	PR has a scoring system just like most other video games out there. If you
beat the top score then you get to enter up to 15 letters, and the character
you played will crouch atop a shadowy hill whenever the scores are displayed,
during the game's demo mode. If your score is worthy of a 2nd through 10th
place slot, then you just get to enter three letters. And if your name is
bumped off the top slot, then only its first three letters will be visible.
	Unfortunately, you cannot see your score on the game screen during your
battles. In between battles, when the game shows you what area you have just
conquered, your score is represented by the "number of worshipers" in the
lower right-hand corner. The scores in the chart below are for version 1.7,
though I doubt they've been changed much for version 2.3...

action						worshipers/points awarded

each continue						1
every 1% damage inflicted on opponent		100
first four hits in a single combo			1,000 per hit
fifth and successive hits in a single combo		2,000 per hit (maximum 20,000
per combo)
eating one of your opponent's followers		10,000
opponent eats one of your followers			-10,000
you eat one of your own followers			-40,000
doing a finishing move				50,000
Total Domination					???
Quick Kill						???
world domination					100,000
winning the game					200,000
bonus for winning with less than 10 continues	1,000,000
bonus for winning without continuing		5,000,000 (bonuses aren't cumulative?)

------------------------------
4.5 CPU AI patterns
------------------------------

	The CPU AI in version 2.3 has been almost completely overhauled. From the
second battle on up, the CPU tends to use all its special moves more (except
fatalities, which it never does), more elaborate combos, and cannot be as
easily suckered with a constant barrage of attacks as before. But in addition
to its new strengths, the CPU has also gained new weaknesses. Generally, you
can win by anticipating and retaliating against the CPU's tendency to jump
and/or use special moves. Here are some very brief weaknesses to exploit, if
you want to rule the new Urth...

4.5.1 CPU Armadon

	Armadon, Blizzard, Chaos, & Talon can use their low 1+2 to hit CPU Armadon
out of the air when he jumps, which is very often. He's also a sucker for
Armadon's Rushing Uppercut, Diablo's Mega Lunge, and Chaos'/Sauron's air
Earthquake. Vertigo can go for a low 1+2, Fast Venom Spit combo, or bite him
out of the air with her low 2 if she's far enough away, then do a Venom Spit
as he gets up. He'll probably jump with a 4; she can wait until after he
swings his tail, knock him down with another bite, and repeat.
	Armadon always starts his turn in the Final Battle with an off-screen wail;
then he leaps in with the Iron Maiden. 

4.5.2 CPU Blizzard

	Armadon and Vertigo can repeatedly swat him with their standing 3+4;
Blizzard can repeatedly use the Short Mega Punch followed by low 1s; Blizzard
and Sauron can air throw him if he doesn't Ice Geyser them first. Diablo and
Sauron can chomp him with their standing 2 when he's just within their range;
Chaos and Sauron can use their air Earthquakes; Talon can do a long jump from
all the way across the screen and target Blizzard's face with the air 3+4.
Everyone can long jump back, in the hope of suckering Blizzard into a Mega
Punch, duck/block the move and knock him down, and repeat.
	Blizzard always starts his round in the Final Battle with the Cold Breath
from off screen; then he jumps in.

4.5.3 CPU Chaos

	He almost always follows up his Power Puke or FoFury with either the
Battering Ram or the Flying Butt Slam. Block/dodge the moves and retaliate.
Vertigo can teleport to the ground on his opposite side and nail him with a
combo that starts with a low 1.
	Chaos always starts the Final Battle with the FoFury from off screen; then
he jumps in with the Flying Butt Slam.

4.5.4 CPU Diablo

	He tends to jump in response to your jumps. Leap toward him with your air 3
until you knock him down; then as he gets up, jump toward him with an air
throw, or your air 1+2 or 3+4 for the lizards, or your air 2 or 4 for the
apes, and he'll probably jump into it. 
	Diablo always starts the Final Battle with a roar from off screen (his voice
is more hoarse than Sauron's - probably a side effect of all that smoking :);
then he teleports in.

4.5.5 CPU Sauron

	He likes to use his air Earthquake Stomp followed up with his standing 1+2 a
lot. When he goes for the Earthquake, long jump toward him (avoiding the
stomp) and combo him.
	Sauron always starts the Final Battle with a roar from off screen. Then
jumps straight down from above with an Earthquake Stomp. He won't follow up
this particular earthquake with his standing 1+2. 

4.5.6 CPU Talon
	He probably has the most vicious of all the overhauled CPU AI's. He'll fall
for Armadon's Iron Maiden, Chaos' & Sauron's air Earthquakes, or Diablo's air
3+4 a lot. Blizzard can tick block-damage off him with combos involving the
Fake Mega Punch. Talon can target his alter ego's backside with the air 1+2.
Everyone can hop jump toward him and make him block some air attack, then low
block his Double Slash and quickly retaliate with a combo.
	Talon always starts the Final Battle with a yowl from off screen, then jumps
in with the Brain Basher. 

4.5.6 CPU Vertigo

	Like Diablo, she tends to jump in response to your jumps. If you jump toward
her from far enough away with a high priority air attack (such as the
lizards' 1+2, or the apes' 2 or 4) then she'll most likely leap into it. 
	Vertigo always starts the Final Battle with a hiss from off screen, then
teleports in, appearing on the ground nearby.

/ARMADON/

     For over a million years Armadon had lived peacefully in his cave
beneath the Earth's crust.  Telepathically linked to the biomass the
cataclysms and the battles for supremacy over the changing planet tortured
him.  So he rose up to settle things once and for all.
     Now that the threat has past he settles down into the ground to enjoy
some well deserved rest.  The land is scarred but calm.  At least for now.

Followed by a picture of Armadon in a cave.  His worshipers have built some
dwellings into the cave's walls; three women are climbing up various ladders.
 Armadon sits in the middle of the cave meditating, with his eyes closed.
 His body is outlined with electricity. 

Picture Caption:  THE MEDITATION OF ARMADON

/BLIZZARD/

      Blizzard is a noble god.  The essence of the animal spirit.  Frozen for
a millennia at the heart of an immense glacier in the Himalayas, Blizzard was
released when the Urth met the great meteor.  He lived high in the mountains
descending only when threatened and with his animal power and age-old wisdom.
He was unstoppable.
      With no threats remaining he returns to his mountain retreat.  One day,
though, a new force will invade his land from across the endless ocean.

This text is followed by a picture depicting Blizzard sitting in a
throne-like ice chair.  He is calmly looks ahead, chin in hand. A man and two
women bow to him; a third woman leans against his icy throne.

Picture Caption:  BLIZZARD'S SOLITUDE

/CHAOS/

     Chaos was the mightiest witch doctor on the first continent.  His
greatest wish was to control the evolution of humanity.  In his quest for
power he cast a mighty spell which backfired and turned him into a disgusting
beast, forced to wallow in his own excrement for eons.  During the cataclysm
Chaos praised Throshti, god of Carrion, for release.  However, to restore his
greatness he had to defeat all of his enemies.
     Now his task completed he regains control of his life and leads his
tribe to greatness.  One day, though, his people will be threatened and he
will have to pursue power again...

Followed by a picture of the human Chaos standing in an archway barely
illuminated by four burning torches. His left hand is on the back of an
almost completely nude woman, who hugs his side. A ghost-like figure of his
ape form is in the background darkness.

Picture Caption:  CHAOS' REDEMPTION

/DIABLO/

     Diablo is evil in its purest form.  He was released from his fiery
prison, deep within the Urth, drawn by the pain and torment caused in the
great cataclysm.  Now that he has conquered the planet, he lives to torture
it.  With none left to oppose him, he begins to burn the entire planet
sparing only the cruel and vicious.  He turns the world into a living hell.
     For centuries he will revel in the inferno he has created, until at last
his rule is challenged by a traveler from across the great sea.

Followed by a picture of Diablo standing near some kind of bloodstained
gallows with skeletons hanging from it. Two worshipers, a man and a woman,
are at his feet. They are apparently fighting for his enjoyment, each using a
single bone as a weapon. Bloody, crucified skeletons surround the de facto
arena. And you thought Shao Kahn was bad... ^_^

Picture Caption:  DIABLO'S HELL

/SAURON/

     Sauron is the god of Hunger.  When released from his sleep of ages by
the catastrophe, he soon realized that he must devour human flesh to remain
immortal.  The hungry hordes of humanity worshiped him, but lived in dread
fear of his presence.  Many humans soon sought refuge with other rulers of
the planet.  Sauron had no choice but to defeat the others in order to feast
on their followers.  Now that he has devoured most of the land, he sets off
in quest of new lands and new meals.

This text is followed by a awesomely sick picture.  It depicts Sauron
standing on the beach next to huge piles of millions of eaten bodies. Faint
images of faraway carrion birds fly above his banquet. A dead body hangs from
Sauron's teeth.  In the foreground there is a mostly eaten, fleshless body
and another body with his skull broken open and brains spilling out [the
brains are censored from the picture in the PR Players Guide!]. The sky is
dark red-orange from a brilliant setting sun. There are no living worshipers.

Picture Caption:  THE FEAST OF SAURON

/TALON/

      For eons, Talon was a great chief of a raptor clan on a hidden South
Pacific island.  When the great meteor rearranged the continents, Talon's
island was brought in contact with the mainland.  Wanting to ensure the
safety of his wives and children, he set off to eliminate all dangers of the
clans welfare.
      Now raptors live a life of luxury and humans are kept as cattle or
hunted as sport while raptors lounge about in the sunshine.  His clan is
completely safe and Talon will be happy until the newcomers arrive.

Followed by a picture of Talon and two smaller raptors without crests
reclining human-style on a grassy hill, under a budding tree. The lounging
raptors are overlooking a wooden cattle style pen containing at least six
worshipers, male and female, two of whom are running from a raptor with a big
net. Outside the pen, two more men flee across the plains from another pair
of raptors.

Picture Caption:  TALON'S DREAM

/VERTIGO/

      Long ago a sorceress named Vertigo appeared from another dimension.
Then in a great magical battle during the Mesozoic Wars Vertigo was banished
to the moon by the arch mage Balsa Fas.  The meteor crash, however, has
weakened the old shields enough for her to return and enslave the planet once
again.
     Reveling in her victory, Vertigo has enslaved hordes of humans having
them build her an insane palace in multiple dimensions.  Few minds can endure
the torture, but there are plenty of humans.  One day while practicing her
arcane arts she discovers a land where she is not queen.

Followed by a picture of a forward-facing Vertigo looking up and hissing in
the middle of some purple swirls. She is standing at a 45-degree angle with
her left foot upraised. She is covered with horizontal stripes (!), and her
hood is framed with jagged points. There is a man and a woman in the
foreground covering their ears. In the background are three Escher-style
stairways with tired looking humans walking up or down them.

--------------
6.1  Colors!!!
--------------

 In version 2.3, all characters come in four colors. You choose your color
when you select your character. Pick your character by holding down either
button 2, button 3, button 4 or no other buttons as you press button 1. 1 is
the Original Recipe color; 1+2 is the old alternate color; 1+3 and 1+4 are
new colors. Should you and another player choose the same character with the
same color, then the one who chose the color in dispute first gets to keep
it. The late chooser is stuck with the Original Recipe color unless that was
the color in dispute, in which case he's stuck with the old alternate color.
	Each character also has a particular color for their conquered
territory/worshipers' clothing. In a character vs same character match, the
other set of worshipers have a slightly different clothing color.

Armadon  
1=ochre&brown 1+2=green&olive 1+3=yellow 1+4=purple ("Barney Armadon" :)
Territory, worshiper's clothing color: neon green
Alternate worshiper's clothing color: olive

6.2  Cheeze Alert
----------------

Are you sick and tired of your opponent yelling, "That's cheezy!"?  Well, PR
has it's own cheeze alert!  If you do something that the _game_ thinks is too
cheezy, it will flash a "No Cheese" sign and the opponent will not be hurt or
stunned by the cheeze. This feature was added as a conscious attempt to
prevent the inescapable traps that have been known to plague other fighting
games. No sign, no cheeze. End of argument. =)

Known Cheeze Alerts:
   Attempted throw immediately after a blocked attack [while opponent is
trapped in "block-stun"]
   Attempt to use same special move twice in a combo
   Attempt to auto-stun/freeze opponent twice in a combo
	[example: Vertigo's Come Slither followed by a Voodoo Spell, or vice-versa]
   2 short slides by Talon in a combo using the Double Slash
   Repeated Inferno Flashes with Diablo [sometimes]
   Hitting with the same basic move more than a certain number of times...???
[say, 4 or 5? sometimes I get stuck in the corner with the CPU, say, after
jumping up to avoid Armadon's leaping attack, & my low 1s keep hitting him
without knocking him back until I get a "No Cheese" meter...]

---------------------
6.3  Eat a worshiper
---------------------

   Eating people is fun and easy!  In version 2.3, worshipers taste better
and are more filling!  They now give significant energy bonuses, so chow
down. Each character has a special move JUST TO EAT PEOPLE, and they're all
different.  See the moves section (which you probably read first!) to find
out how.  Watch it, though, it does take a moment to eat - if your opponent
isn't distracted or stunned, he may bop you and send your dinner flying!
There are six different tribespeople, three men and three women.

Appearance				Name		Health Value

woman with short black hair		Jeanette	least
woman with long blond hair		Tracy		a little
woman with long black hair		Renee		a little
bald man with spear			Jason		medium
muscular man with short hair		Ron		plenty
fat man with dreadlocks		Rob		the most!!!

The worshipers you see onscreen are a representation of the total number of
worshipers/points you've accumulated divided by 50,000, fractions rounded
down, maximum of ten of your followers onscreen at a time. There are always
at least three tribespeople onscreen at the start of a round, even if they
were all eaten last round. The higher your score is, the greater the
probability of having meatier worshipers onscreen (which is especially
helpful during the bonus round before the Final Battle).

NOTE1:  Some characters eat worshipers faster than others.  Blizzard, for
example, takes his time chomping on a human & spits out the bones, while
Talon just stuffs 'em in his mouth.

Fastest eaters:  Diablo, Sauron, Talon
Medium eaters: Armadon, Vertigo
Slowest eaters:  Blizzard, Chaos

NOTE2: If you're having trouble pursuing & accidentally bopping your dinner,
keep 3+4 held down all the time, from before the bonus round starts. Your
character can walk back and forth with these buttons held down. When you're
in the right position to eat your dinner, hold down 1+2 as well (even if you
do a bite by accident, it probably won't disturb the humans) and then move
the joystick.

--------------------
6.4  Going ballistic
--------------------

This feature occurs only in human vs human matches. On version 1.7 &
presumably 2.3 as well, each character goes ballistic if he/she

1) Has 50% less health than the opponent
2) Has less than 30% health left
3) The character gets hit out of a special move, tripped, thrown, or hit out
of the air (i.e. gets knocked down)

The wounded character's brain meter crackles as if telegraphing a stun, but
when they get up they starts flickering and go into the ballistic state. The
character announces this state with a brief, recycled piece of animation
during which they can't hurt or be hurt by their opponent (sort of like the
"full POW meter" animations in Samurai Shodown II.) In the ballistic state,
all your attacks do significantly more damage. You can tell if you are in
that state if your character is flickering and has one of these words under
your character's name.

     Armadon - SAMADHI [Bed-o'-Nails animation]
     Blizzard - ZEN [Ice Geyser animation]
     Chaos - INSANE [Power Puke animation]
     Diablo - STEAMED [Inferno fatality animation]
     Sauron - RAMPAGING [Primal Scream animation]
     Talon - BERSERK [Frantic Fury animation]
     Vertigo - RABID [hood flare from victory animation]

On version 1.7, going ballistic has the following effects:

1) your attacks do 40% more damage than usual [fractions are rounded down]
2) you receive 15% less damage from any attack
3) you take zero block-damage
4) you have no combo regulation (combos are normally regulated so that after
a certain number of hits, each successive hit does only so much damage)
5) you can stay ballistic for 20 clock ticks at the most

I suspect these are also the case for version 2.3... can anyone confirm?

6.5  Final Battle *new info*
--------------------------------

	After beating all of the opponent while playing against the computer, you
arrive at a stage where you have to fight all seven characters again in one
big round, with the clock turned off. This is called the "Final Battle." It
takes place on a special "Dinosaur Graveyard" stage littered with mounds of
dinosaur bones, including a couple big skeletons propped up to the left. The
ground has bright red cracks in it, and there's a huge, swirling vortex in
the sky. If you die during the Final Battle then you can continue from the
precise point at which you left off, but you cannot change characters and no
second player can join in.
  	Fortunately, there are three ways to make the Final Battle easier. The
first is to do fatalities on as many opponents as you can (remember that you
can't do a fatality on an opponent if your second win is a "time over"
victory). Dead enemies will flicker like ghosts in the Final Battle, and
every attack you do to them will inflict double the normal damage. Regardless
of whether a given enemy is solid or flickering, when you exhaust his/her
health meter then he/she will collapse and revert to bones, which will become
part of the background.
	The second advantage is to know each CPU foes' signature entrance,
anticipate it, and dodge or retaliate. For example, jump up to avoid
Armadon's Iron Maiden and then pound him with a combo on the way down
(signature entrances are described in the section 4.5, "CPU AI PATTERNS").
There are two ways to tell which opponent you'll fight next. One is to watch
for the name under the enemy's health meter, which appears just as the battle
starts. The other is to listen for the enemy's voice (or projectile sound,
for the apes). Unlike some other fighting games, PR has given each character
a unique voice for their wordless battle cries/screams of pain.
	Your third advantage is that before arriving at this stage, you have a
chance to acquire more than 100% total strength.  There is a 20-second
mini-round where all you do is eat worshipers for more strength.  It is
possible to obtain up to an extra 100% health, which will appear in a green
life meter after your red life meter has been exhausted. You can eat people
or pterodactyls in the bonus round by doing each character's 'Eat a
worshiper' move, or just use a normal bite to eat the pterodactyls. Even if
you can't find anything to eat, 18% extra health automatically trickles into
your reserve life bar [on version 1.7, anyway ^_^].

A little phrase that pops up during this mini-round:

     Armadon - TO GIVE YOU STRENGTH FOR THE FINAL CONFRONTATION, YOUR TRIBE
SACRIFICES ITSELF TO YOU.
     Blizzard - NOW, DINE ON A FINE FEAST OF FOLLOWERS.
     Chaos - CHOW DOWN, IT'S A PAGAN PICNIC.
     Diablo - FEASTING FRENZY!
     Sauron - EAT OF YOUR TRIBE THAT YOU MIGHT REMAIN IMMORTAL
     Talon - CHEW UP AS MANY HUMANS AS YOU CAN
     Vertigo - SWALLOW THE TINY HUMANS WHOLE

FINAL BATTLE BUG in VERSION 1.7:
     At the mini-round, do NOT get 100% health.  If you do, in the Final
Battle, when you lose your first 100% of health, you will NOT get the health
you earned in the mini-round.  Your game will be over.

FINAL BATTLE BUG in VERSION 2.3:

Twice now, I've seen a second entire *red* life meter appear after the first
red life meter was used up, but before the green life meter was started. It
happened once while I was watching a friend play Armadon, and once while I
was playing Blizzard. Not to complain, but it was kind of weird... 

-------------------------------------
6.6  Secrets - Volleyball, Bowling, and Raining Cows
-------------------------------------

6.6.1  Volleyball

When you and an opponent are on Sauron's stage, have one player do a combo on
the other.  Once you do this, a worshiper will run out and start bowing. Have
one player who is close to the worshiper hit the worshiper.  The worshiper
should bounce over to the other player.  Before the worshiper lands, have the
other player hit the worshiper back.  After bouncing the worshiper back and
forth ten times, a judge on a high chair and a net will pop up and the round
clock stop.  You and your opponent can now play volleyball with a helpless
human!  Once a player reaches a score of three, you go resume fighting.  You
can eat the "ball" too.  With Vertigo, I ate the ball twice when I hit quick
bite!  I lost the point because of that!

6.6.2  Bowling

On any stage, have two Armadon players continuously execute the Spinning
Death on each other.  After three Spinning Death collisions, the worshipers
will then get into a bowling pin formation and let you roll over them with
the Spinning Death.

6.6.3 Raining Cows (unconfirmed)

Mentioned in the "Primal Rage Arcade Player's Guide" by the guys at GamePro.
Play as Chaos in his home stage (the Ruins). Arrange for a Sudden Death round
to take place (see below). If you do a FoFury so that the green cloud is in
the air as the Sudden Death begins, the sky will rain cows instead of
meteors. Can anyone confirm this?

-----------------
6.7  Sudden Death
-----------------

	A draw in PR is announced with the words "DEAD EVEN" and does not count as a
win for either contestant. If you and your opponent end up with only one win
each after the third round, you end up in a "Sudden Death" round.  The round
lasts for only 30 seconds [20 seconds on version 1.7] and has a meteor shower
thrown in.  Both players begin with a full bar of health and 30 seconds for
the round.  As the round begins, each players' health decreases at a steady
rate and both fight as usual until one loses. Whoever wins the Sudden Death
round wins the match and has the usual opportunity to perform a fatality on
the loser.
	Since both characters' energy bars are empty by the end of the 30 seconds,
neither character can get a "time over" victory. If "Sudden Death" ends in a
draw, then both opponents lose and you lose your credit. During the continue
countdown, instead of one victorious critter & one unconscious critter,
you'll see both contestants lying unconscious, side by side.

---------------
6.8  PR version
---------------

	To check the version of PR you have, push up on the left joystick and pull
down on the right simultaneously.  This works only on the title screen.  The
"production version" is 1.7.  If you have a beta version, bug your arcade
owner to get it updated!  The "Hot New Version 2" that Atari has made a
spiffy sign for is 2.3, and has "Version 2.3" on the title screen in big
letters made of bones.  It has many features that will turn various players
on or off, depending...

Brief list of version 2.3 changes:

-demo mode intro text has letters made of bones instead of normal black
letters
-one new fatality for each character added
-eating humans adds much more energy to your health meter
-100% health bug from 1.7 fixed
-general gameplay sped up, especially projectiles
-little "Christmas Lights" added; they flash with every strike, blocked or
not
-gone are the faint "blue shields" that used to appear when blocking attacks
-generally, damage to heart & brain meters decreased, but block-damage to
heart increased 
-all leaping attacks can now be blocked 
-if you're on the ground, projectiles don't knock you down anymore
-combo names, Total Domination, Quick Kill features added
-Sudden Death lasts for 30 seconds instead of 20
-hop jumps can now be used vs the CPU
-CPU's "AI" patterns changed; many old tricks no longer work, but some new
tricks do
-"fatality"/'no fatality" music added; other music enriched w/more percussion
-Armadon's Spinning Death doesn't go under projectiles anymore
-Armadon's Rushing Uppercut throws his victim higher up (the better to volley
'em! :)
-Blizzard's Cold Breath & Ice Geyser don't freeze opponents for as long
-Chaos' Battering Ram makes an annoying new sound
-Chaos & Sauron can do their Earthquake moves in the air
-Diablo's Torch combos more easily
-Talon's Pounce & Flip does no block-damage
-Talon's Shredder fatality made gorier
-Vertigo has a new teleport, and can do both old & new teleports in the air

6.9  NEW UPGRADE
----------------

Another update for Primal Rage has been scheduled!

The next chip upgrade is scheduled for Jan '95 and will contain a new
character!  An Atari TWI rep told Zargon it will be a boss character but will
the character be playable?  Hopefully, yes!
[Note: as of this writing it is March '95, and still no upgrade. I've heard
rumors that the new chip will show up later than anticipated, perhaps by this
fall or winter, and more rumors that the new boss will be a dracolich (an
animate dragon skeleton)].
