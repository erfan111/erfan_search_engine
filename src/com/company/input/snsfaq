Stratagy

People with long range kicks and punches, like Scorpion, can just
stand and wait for their opponent to come, then repeatedly kick
them.  This works well because you inflict a lot of damage upon
them, while they don't even touch you.                   

The second stratagy is the grab and slam.  Just grab your
opponent, and do a move that gets them on the ground.  
Preferrably, a super slam.  Then, walk over to them, pull them
up, and do your super slam again.  Repeat this process up to
three times.  Note some characters can't do this because their
super slam doesn't set them up well for another one.  

The third stratagy is to get you opponent out of the ring
(1 player match only)  then pummle him with the weapons 
outside of the ring.  Hammer Throwing him also works well,
since they hit the railing which takes a good amount of 
energy from him.  

Sometimes, usually on the first opponent, I get him to come 
out of the ring, then I just keep him down on the floor
and barely make it in the 20 count.  This is most easily 
accomplished by hammer throwing him against the far guard
rail when the count is at about 17 or 18.  The only problem
is if the computer doesn't give up right away and manages to
delay your hammer throw, or slam you, you could either end
up losing the match, or getting a D.K.O. (Double Count Out)


Turnbuckles

Once you know how to use the turnbuckle jump effectively,
they are one of the best moves in the game.  To jump off
the ropes, hit jump, then in the air, hit attack.  Hitting
attack while on the turnbuckle will result in some kind of
taunt, which gets the crowd fired up.  As far as I know,
Stinger has the best moves off the turnbuckle.  Turnbuckle
moves take a lot of damage, sometimes as much or more than
the super slams


Give up Holds and Special Pins

Every character has either a special pin, give up hold,
or both.  Give up holds tend to be better, because they
take less time for you to finish you opponent off.  Thus,
making it harder for your opponents partner (in Team Battle)
to knock you off before you can get the three count.
