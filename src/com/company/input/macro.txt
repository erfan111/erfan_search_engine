1.0) What is Microvision?

Microvision was introduced by Milton Bradley in 1979.  Designed by Jay
Smith (who later designed Vectrex), Microvision combined the cartridge 
interchangability that was propelling Fairchild and Atari into the 
forefront with the portability that had helped Coleco and Mattel sell 
millions of hand held games.  While the idea was fine (witness the success
of Gameboy and Game Gear), the timing and support were not.  After some
initial success (grossing $8 million in its first year of production,
and boosting Smith Engineering into a million-dollar operation), and an
initial release of seven cartridges (including Block Buster, which came 
with the unit), Milton Bradley rolled out just two new cartridges in 1980, 
and a final two in 1981.  With a small library, no tie in to a home unit,
and a screen resolution that provided little ability to produce meaningful 
graphics, Microvision soon became little more than a memory.

Still, the Microvision was a pioneer, overcoming the limitations of the 
light-emitting-diode displays that were standard for hand-held games at the 
time.  For all the limitations of the unit, many of the games produced were 
quite good. - JH, 02, 05

The original game units used two 9-volt batteries, but it was discovered 
that not only could Microvision run on one 9-volt battery, but Microvision
owners would sometimes put one of the batteries in backwards.  Later
units only provided terminals for one battery, with the second spot
marked "spare battery storage". - JH, 02

4.0) Trivia

Robert Hoffberg programmed Connect Four and Cosmic Hunter, as well as
assisting on Sea Duel and Baseball.

Cartridge programming was done at Milton Bradley in East Longmeadow, MA,
Texas Instruments in Dallas, TX, and in Santa Monica,CA.

There are at least two different boxes which the Microvision unit was
packaged in.  One lists only the six original carts; the second adds
Baseball and Sea Duel.

Cosmic Hunter and Alien Raiders, the last two releases, have "control"
numbers which don't match the part number on the box (MB8106 for Cosmic 
Hunter, MB8107 for Alien Raiders).

The original units did not include an anti-static shield.  These shields,
which fit above the LCD screen, were included with cartridges and also sent
out with repaired units.


5.0) Instructions

BLOCK BUSTER (and unit):

(Two battery version)

Operating Procedures

Inserting the Batteries

1. Turn the console over.  Using a fingernail, lift up the locking tab on
   the battery compartment cover and lift it off.  See Fig. 1.

(Fig. 1 - The back of the Microvision unit, showing the contrast knob above
 the battery compartment.)

(Fig. 2 - The back of the Microvision unit, with the battery compartment
 open and two batteries inserted.)

2. You need two 9 Volt transistor batteries to operate Microvision.  
   Alkaline batteries are recommended for batter performance and longer
   life.  Make sure they are fresh and strong as even new batteries may
   be defective or weak and may cause unsatisfactory operation.
3. Insert the two batteries as shown in Fig. 2 matching the charge 
   marked on the battery symbols indicated on the inside of the
   compartment.
4. Replace the battery cover and turn the console face up.

Inserting the Cartridge

1. First, check to sure the On/OFF switch is down in the OFF position.
   Then, holding the cartridge at an angle, slide the top of the
   cartridge into the slot at the top of the console.  See Fig. 3.

(Fig. 3 - Front of Microvision unit with cartridge being inserted.)

2. Then, press down, snapping the cartridge into place.
3. To remove the cartridge: Make sure the power is off.  Grasp the sides
   of the cartridge at the grooves, squeeze slightly, and pull up.  (DO
   NOT FORCE.)  Then, gently slide the cartridge out.

Contrast Knob

1. When you turn the game on, you may notice that the screen contrast
   needs adjustment.
   Note: The contrast has been factory adjusted to room temperature
         (approximately 70 degrees)
2. Locate the contrast knob on the back of the console (refer to Fig. 1).
   Insert a dime (a fingernail, etc.) into the groove in the knob and
   turn it until you achieve the desired contrast.

Special Cautions

1. It is recommended that you use and store you Microvision console and 
   cartridges at temperatures ranging from 32F to 104F.
2. The liquid crystal display is sensitive to direct sunlight, abrupt
   temperature changes, high humidity or dampness, and dust.  It is 
   best to avoid using your game in areas where the above conditions
   are present.
3. Do not press down on the screen area or subject your game to impact
   or shocks.
4. Do not handle the contacts at the top of the cartridge.
5. If you will not be playing the game for a day or more, it is
   recommended that you remove the cartridge from the console.
6. If you leave the power on for an extended period of time with the
   cartridge in the console, permanent damage to the display will occur.

Battery Replacement

1. When the batteries are losing power, the screen may blank out or the
   display could appear erratic.
2. Turn the power off, remove the battery cover, and replace your old
   batteries with fresh 9 volt (alkaline type) batteries.

                                IMPORTANT

Turn the power off when not playing the game.  Microvision will alert
you periodically with a signal if you leave the power on when you are 
not playing the game.

Game Play for Block Buster

Object:

Knock out all the blocks in the 3-layer wall using a ball & paddle.

1. Slide the ON/OFF switch up to ON.  The option screen will appear.
2. Press the BALLS key to select the number of balls that you want to
   play (1, 3, 5, 7, or 9).
3. Press the SPEED key to select the speed of the serve (Fast or Slow).
4. Press the PADDLE key to select the width of the paddle (Triple or
   Double).
   Note: The Double width paddle, because it only allows for diagonal
         play, requires a greater degree of skill to master.
5. Press GO and the score screen appears.  Press GO again and the wall
   and paddle appear on the screen.
   Note: If you do not press another key on the keyboard within
         approximately 10 seconds, the game will signal you and will
         display the score on the screen.  This is to remind you that
         the game is still on.
6. Turn the Control Knob on the console to move the paddle from side to
   side.
7. Press GO to serve the ball.  Bounce the ball off the paddle into the
   wall.  When the ball hits the wall, it eliminates a block.  Try to 
   volley the ball as many times as you can.  If you eliminate all the
   blocks, a new wall appears and the same ball is still in play.
8. When you miss a ball, your score and the number of balls you have
   left appears on the screen.
9. Press GO to show the wall and paddle.  Press GO again to serve the
   next ball.
10. If you have the speed set on Slow, the pace quickens when you hit
    a block in the top row.  If you have the speed set on Fast, the rate
    will remain fast at all times.
11. When you have played all the balls chosen at the beginning of the
    game, the game is over and you will see your score.
12. Press GO to return to the option screen.  Press GO to show the score
    screen.  Press GO to show the wall and paddle.  Press GO again to
    serve the ball.

Scoring

You get 1 point for each block you hit in the bottom row, 2 points for 
each block in the middle row, and 3 points for each block in the top
row.  Each complete wall totals 96 points.  (After reaching 999 points,
you must and 1,000's to the score that shows on the screen.)

Remember - Turn the power off when not playing the game.

Operating Procedures

FOR BEST RESULTS USE ALKALINE BATTERIES ONLY!
Alkaline batteries are recommended for better performance and longer life.
Make sure they are fresh and strong as even new batteries may be defective
or weak and may cause unsatisfactory operation.

Inserting the Batteries

1. Turn the console over.  Using a fingernail, lift up the locking tab on
   the battery compartment cover and lift it off.  See Fig. 1.

(Fig. 1 - The back of the Microvision unit, showing the contrast knob above
 the battery compartment.)

(Fig. 2 - The back of the Microvision unit, with the battery compartment
 open and two batteries inserted - the one on the left marked "functioning
 battery", the one on the right marked "spare battery storage".)

2. Only ONE 9 volt transistor battery is needed to operate Microvision.  
   We suggest you buy two alkaline batteries, use one to operate the
   unit and keep the other as a spare in the easily accessible Spare
   Battery Storage area [remember the spare is always there when you
   need it!].  See Figure 2. for the proper positioning of the
   functioning battery and the spare battery.
3. Make sure the functioning battery is inserted properly.  To make the
   proper connection, insert the terminal heads as shown in the detailed
   diagram on the bottom of the battery compartment in the console, 
   itself.
4. Now insert the spare battery in the Spare Battery Storage area right
   next to the functioning battery.
5. Replace the battery cover and turn the console face up.

6.0) Programming the Microvision

Programming the Microvision is complicated by the fact that, unlike nearly
every other cartridge based system, the CPU for each Microvision cartridge
is included on the cartridge.  Furthermore, the game code is included on
the same chip. - 02

The LCD driver chip is a 40 pin chip located in the Microvision base unit. 
The lines are Pwr, Gnd, 32 outputs to the LCD, 4 inputs from the 
microcomputer, strobe input and latch input.  The LCD driver chip is very 
primitive.  Screen contents must be latched 4 bits at a time, with a
total of 8 packets making up one screen.  After all 8 packets have been
latched, they must be strobed in to complete one multiplex.  Up to 12
multiplex levels are possible.  Finally, the voltage on the LCD must
be inverted by turning the latch on, then toggling the strobe, and
finally the shutting the latch off.  The voltage must be inverted
roughly 35 times per second, or the LCD glass will be etched with
electrons.  

Be forewarned, when working with Microvision cartridges, that they (or, more 
specifically, the built in CPUs) are very susceptible to electrostatic 
discharges.

8.0) Microvision Dealers

Microvision units and cartridges are nearly impossible to find.  When 
they are available, it's usually at a premium - I've seen asking prices
as high as $30 for a cartridge, $75 for a unit.  However, even as a 
dedicated fan or garage sales, thrift stores, and flea markets, I've
only once come across any Microvision equipment, and at that it didn't
come cheaply.

Given the relative scarcity of Microvision products, few dealers can
keep an inventory of such items.  Therefore, while the following dealers 
have been known to sell Microvision products, there is no guarantee that
they currently stock any items.

Note: the following are listed alphabetically.  Inclusion on this list 
carries with it no recommendation, either positive or negative, about 
the dealer.  Additional dealers who sell a line of Microvision products 
via mail order will be gladly added to the list.
