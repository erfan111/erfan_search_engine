                                <1> History
                                ===========

The three incarnations of version 0 were just a rewrite of my arcade moves
list, with a few moves for the three-button controls thrown in from folks who
had sent them to me.  If you have a version 0 sheet, burn it now and keep this
one. :>

Version 1.0 : I wrote this overnight, after I finally (after many tries) got
a hold of a copy of the game.  I typed everything in from scratch, so 
naturally there were typos and other mistakes.

Version 1.1 : Major typo fixes and changes to Q/A's.

Version 1.1a : Minor mistakes corrected.
 
Version 1.2 : Once I had enough minor mistakes fixed, I decided to bump
up the version to 1.2 and add in some formatting changes.  Thanks and
wanted sections added.  Headers added before each character's moves.

Version 1.2a : New move(s) added as they were discovered.

Version 1.3 : Pong and the Fergality added.

Version 1.3a : Typos corrected.

Version 1.4 : More moves confirmed and corrected, and some info explained
in better detail.

                              <2> Special thanks

                                   <3> Wanted
                                   ==========

The following is info that I do not currently have in this FAQ, but would
like to have.  Your help is much appreciated!

Kung Lao's decapitation fatality (3 button);
Cage's special (three-head) fatality (3 button).

                           <4> Key to the moves list
                           =========================

"w" "x" "y" and "z" all represent stick and/or button motions, and "n"
represents a number.

f = forward, b = back, u = up, d = down.
p = low punch, P = high punch,  k = low kick, K = high kick, B = block.
In the 3-button pad moves, "p" is used for the punch button (since there's only
one).
Q = quarter-circle, H = half-circle, C = full circle.  These moves are always
followed by either f or b indicating the direction of the circular stick move.

xyz w : Unless otherwise stated, stick/button motions are to be done
        sequentially.  In most moves that end with a button press, the button
        is separated from the rest of the moves by a space, just for ease of
        reading.  In most cases, you are allowed to hold the stick in the
        last position while pressing the button.  IOW, it's OK to do
        xyz(w).  The cases where this is NOT true are noted like this:
xyz/w : The slash indicates that you MUST release the stick from position z
        before pressing the button w.
x+y   : Do x and y at the same time.
x(y)  : Hold the control x and do y while holding x.  y may be more than one
        motion or button press.
        When combined with a circular stick move, this notation means to do
        the circular move, then hold the stick in the final position (forward
        or back) while pressing the indicated button.  So, Qb(k) means, "Do
        a quarter-circle backwards, and while holding the stick in the back
        position, press low kick."
x(y)R : Do x(y) and then release x to complete the move.  y may be more than
        one motion or button press.
x[n]  : Hold (charge) button x for at least n ticks of the game clock.  The
        move is complete when you charge for the indicated length of time and
        release x.
x..   : Keep tapping the button(s) x to keep the move going.

Fatalities are sensitive to the distance you stand from your opponent.  A
number in parentheses after the move name tells you how far away to stand.  The
distances are numbered:

0   : Stand right next to the victim.
1   : Stand one character-width away.
2   : Stand two character-widths away.
3   : Stand halfway across the screen.
4   : Stand all the way across the screen.
*   : Stand anywhere, distance doesn't matter.
n+  : Stand at a distance of n or farther.
n-  : Stand at a distance of n or closer.

                             ====================

                               =================

Here it is!  The (almost) complete list of moves for both types of control
pads.  The few moves that I haven't been able to do yet are marked with
question marks.  I would REALLY like to have all the moves here, so 
please feel free to experiment and mail me with your results. :>

Take care when using the 3 button pad.  My experience is that it is very picky
at times, especially about whether you hold the last stick motion while
pressing a button at the end of a special move.

*** Important note ***
In moves which contain an "up" stick move (except for teleports),
it seems that you may hold block during the entire move.  You may even hold
block while pressing the final button.  This, needless to say, is VERY generous
of the programmers. :>
*** Important note ***

*** Semi-Important note ***
All Pit/Spikes fatalities are done at a distance of 0.

Note: On the 6-button pad, the Friendship and Pit/Spikes fatality are the
same move.  If you are able to do a friendship (ie, haven't used punch in
the second round you win) and you do dddd K, you will ALWAYS get the
Friendship, instead of the Pit/Spikes fatality.

                            <7> Guide to the menus
                            ======================

Start : Starts the game (duh!)
Options : brings up the Options menu.

Options/Difficulty : Very easy, easy, medium, hard, or very hard.  Pick one.
Options/Credits : You can choose to start with between 1 and 30 credits.  Put
   the cursor on the "Gimme 15!" line and move the stick left/right to decrease
   or increase the number of credits.
Options/Extra Controls : This menu has an option for each port.  The possible
   choices are "Activator" and "6 Button."  If you're using the 3-button pad,
   choose "Activator."  **NOTE** Pressing RESET resets both of these settings
   to "Activator."  Choosing "6 button" only makes the game LOOK FOR a 6
   button pad; you can still use your 3 button pad (you can even switch your
   6 button pad between 6 button and 3 button modes if you want to).

If you move the cursor to the Options/DONE! setting and do the sequence
ldlrdrllrr, another menu choice will appear, "Test modes."

                           <8> Using the Test modes
                           ========================

Note: Pressing RESET removes the Test Modes menu from the Options menu, and
turns off all settings in the Test Modes menu. 

The first two options make player 1 or 2 invincible.  Only one of these options
may be set on, for obvious reasons.

The next two options make player 1 or 2 die with one hit.  Even a Kitana fan
lift or Sub-Zero freeze will be deadly.  Both of these options may be set on at
the same time, although you cannot have a player be both "invincible" and "die
with one hit" at the same time.

The 2nd page begins with "Free Play."  Set this on for infinite credits.

The "Background" option is next.  Leaving it at the default "OFF" setting gives
you the backgrounds in the normal order.  Setting it to a number makes every
single match take place at the same background.  Settings of note are: 1 (Dead
Pool), 2 (Room with the Spikes), 6 (Armory), 7 (The Pit), 8 (The Portal), and
10 (The Blue Portal where you normally fight hidden characters).

"Battle Plan" determines where your game begins when you fight against the
computer.  Leave it OFF to start at the bottom, or set it to a number to start
at a higher-up opponent.  11 is the character right before the ? box, 13 is
Shang Tsung, 14 is Kintaro, and 15 is Shao Kahn.

The next option, strangely called "Soak Test," makes the computer play itself
when you choose Start.

The 3rd page begins with three options, only one of which may be set at once:
"Fatalities, "Friendship," and "Babalities."  Setting one will make the
computer do the respective finishing move whenever it wins a match.  The
computer will be able to do Friendships and Babalities even if it used punches
during the last round!

The last option is "Oooh, Nasty!"  See the Q&A section for an explanation.

                     <9> Questions and miscellaneous stuff
                     =====================================

Q: What is a Fergality?  [or]  What does "Oooh, Nasty!" do?
A: First, enable the Test Modes and then enable Oooh, nasty!  Then, start
a game and use Raiden.  On the Armory stage, win the match, and at the end,
do bbb B.  The victim will be turned into one of the programmers.

Q: What are babalities and friendships?
A: They are alternate ways of ending a match that you've won.  You may stand
anywhere on the screen when doing them.  A Babality will turn the victim into a
little baby, complete with distinctive clothing (e.g. Kung Lao and Raiden
babies still have their hats on).  A Friendship will make your character do
something cute, for example Kitana turns around and produces a birthday cake. 
The only restriction on babalities and friendships is that you may not press
either punch button during the 2nd round that you win.

Q: How do I do Random Select?
A: At the character selection screen, put the cursor on Liu Kang if you're 
player 1, or on Reptile if you're player 2.  Then, hold up and press START.

Q: What is the Dead Pool fatality?
A: When you win a match on the Dead Pool stage (the one with the green pools of
acid behind the characters), hold d+p+k and press P on the 6 button, or d+k+K
and press p on the 3 button.  Do this at a distance of 0.  There doesn't seem
to be the "Almost" quote that was in the arcade.

Q: How do I make the victim of a Spikes fatality fall back to the ground?
A: Hold YOUR joystick down right after your character begins the uppercut
motion.  You do not have to hold both sticks down, as in the arcade.  If
the computer does a Spikes fatality on you, you can hold the stick in the
other port down and make yourself fall! :>  Of course, sometimes victims
will fall down of their own accord.

Q: What are "special" fatalities?
A: That's my term for the two easter eggs in Cage's and Scorp's fatalities.
A "special" takes a normal fatality and does something extra at the end.
Try them and you'll see what I mean. :>

Q: How do I get to Jade?
A: First, play the computer and get to the opponent right before the ? box. 
You must then win one round (just a round, not the whole match) using ONLY low
kick.  If you do so, you'll fight Jade.  After the match with her is over,
you'll go back to the regular game and fight Shang Tsung.

Q: How do I get to Smoke?
A: During the Portal stage, connect with an uppercut or Kung Lao's spin.  Then
watch the lower-right corner of the screen.  If the head pops up and you hear
"toasty!" hold down and press START.

Q: How do I get to Noob Saibot?
A: Win 50 rounds in a row.  You do NOT have to play against the computer
during your winning streak.

Q: Why can't I change characters after I fight a hidden character?
A: Programmers goofed/were lazy and didn't code it.

Q: Does Pong exist in the Sega version?
A: Yes.  It appears after 200 matches.  (or so I've been told...I tried it
this afternoon and it most definitely did NOT appear *sniff*)

Q: Who's that dude that pops up in the corner of the screen?
A: That's Dan Forden.  He composed the music for MK2.  He sometimes appears
whenever you connect with an uppercut or Kung Lao's energy spin.  BTW, he says
"toasty!"

Q: No, I didn't see a man, it was some strange yellow blob.
A: Dan's picture is replaced by some strange-looking character when you play
after turning on the Test modes menu.  It still says "toasty!" though.

Q: I have an SNES!! Can I use this moves list?
A: YES!! :>  Folks on ISCA have told me that the SNES moves are the same
as the 6-button pad moves listed here.  Just substitute as follows:
high punch = Y   high kick = X
low punch  = B   low kick  = A
block = L or R

Q: So, Mike, what do you think of the game?
A: I like it.  It's a much much better translation of the arcade game than MK1
was.  The lack of voices is disappointing, though.  I also find it strange that
after you fight a hidden character, you can't select a different character. 
The computer is NO fun to play against, even on the easy difficulty settings,
which really detracts from the game if you don't have many people to play with
(as I don't).

Q: Hey!  I found a mistake!!  [or]  Hey!  I found something new!!  Now what do
I do?
A: Just email me and tell me all about it.  I'm always looking for new and
better info. :>

OUTSTANDING!!  Have a nice day. :>
