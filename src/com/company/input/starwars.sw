the recommeneded settings are 6 shields, hard game play, 1 bonus shield, music
in attract, and normal game play
 
There is another 8-toggle switch that controls the amount of coins and such
If you have setting 1 and 2 both On, it will give free game play, otherwise
the sequence is the same as above, with options as follows: 2 credits, 1, 1/2.
The other settings just deal with the 2 coin mechanisms, and I doubt they
would be important to you.  This setting switch should be called 10E/F
 
There is one more 4 setting toggle switch, only 1 is used.  If it is on then
The outputs of counter driver 1 and 2 are tied together (for 1 counter). If it
is off, then the counters are separate (for 2 counters).
