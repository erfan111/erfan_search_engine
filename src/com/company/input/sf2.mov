Here is a graphical representation of all the special moves for HF.
All the moves are for facing to the right.  When used in a phrase,
the symbol "|" means or.  The word beg. is beginning.  The charge times
shown are relative to the game's speed.  So, a 2 second charge on CE is
longer than on HF.  The words in parentheses show which attribute of
the special move is affected by using different button strengths.
