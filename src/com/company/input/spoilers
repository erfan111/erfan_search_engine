                   maintained by Tony Iaconetti
                   (Iaconetti_a@spcvxa.spc.edu)
 Updated Friday December 9, 1994

Based on a list originally created by craig@sae.com (Craig H. Heartwell)
and then maintained by deloura@noaapmel.gov (Robert DeLoura)

Unless specified otherwise, all codes are on Controller #1.

Up, Down, Left, Right are on the directional keypad, whereas L and R
are the buttons on the controller.

If you have a tip or a cheat that isn't included here or if you find a
code which needs to be corrected, let me know.  I'll update the List,
and add your email address to the list of contributors.

Professional Mode - After completing the game, ATS press  Up 
(or Down twice).  The "Professional" selection will appear below  
"New Game".  You don't get any magic, and regular monsters take 
twice as many hits to kill.

Extra 1-Ups - There are at least 3 extra 1-Ups to be had while 
directing the building of towns.  If you cause it to rain over 
the lake east of Bloodpool, the people will find and present you 
with the first one.  In Kasandora, once you have uncovered the 
pyramid cause an earthquake and another source of life will be 
uncovered. The third one is collected by striking the Northwood 
temple with lightning. (these are actually listed in the 
instructions)

Super Bullets - To destroy your enemies with only one of your
machine gun shots, start a game and go to a place that youcan
confront an enemy. Once you have an enemy in your sights, switch
your weapon to machine guns and start shooting. Once your target
is hit, pause the game. The target should still be taking hits
and will blow up. Timing is critical.

is a staircase leading into his domain.  There is also a massive 
drop from the platform into the depths of the unknown.  Luckily, 
things are not as they seem.  If you take a large jump off the 
edge of the platform, you will find yourself on an invisible 
ledge that will lead down some stairs going to the left.  Go as 
far as you can to the left and powerups will fall in large 
quantities.  Collect 99 hearts, a triple boomerang, and the best 
whip.  Be careful not to fall off the edge when going back.

The Clayfighter Moves List - Version 2

From: awood@lynx.dac.neu.edu (Adam Wood)

Several important changes needed to be made to the list.  First of all,
I found out why Blob's Flying Roundhouse was so temperamental.  It was,
of course, because I was doing it wrong.  To do the move, you must push
away first, then do the "Dragon Kick".  In addition, a kind soul named
Christopher L. Schneider helped me discover that none of the other moves
previously listed as "Dragon Punches" needed to be done that way: T,
DT&P would suffice.  In addition, he told me that Bonker's Aerial
Shuffle can be done in midair, using a totally different pad motion.
Playing around with this, I discovered an interesting thing about the
way charge moves work; I have added this to the list as note 3, removing
the old note 3 which has become totally obsolete.

So, without further ado, here we go...

Joypad: D=down, U=up, T=towards opponent, A=away from opponent
two adjacent letters represents the appropriate diagonal
hold = hold the pad down in that direction for about 2 seconds
minimum before continuing (except where noted)
Buttons: P=punch, K=kick
Usually, light attack buttons execute shorter or slower versions
of the special moves than when stronger attack buttons are used.
When the effect is radically different, I will specify what happens.
Notes: 1) Commas separate motions that should be done consecutively;
for example, if given D, DT, T, rotate the pad from down to towards,
going through the diagonal.  Ampersands (&'s) represent moves to be
done simultaneously. [Just in case you've never played a fighting
game before.]
2) For moves listed as "(can be done in midair)", hold away while 
on the ground, then jump backwards (still holding away), then press
forward and the attack button.
3) For charge moves, the direction to be held can be replaced by an
adjacent diagonal [for example, DA may be held instead of D], but
the proper direction must be returned to before the move is
launched.  [For example, Frosty's Snow Ball may be done by holding
DA for 2 seconds, then rotating the pad up to A for just a split
second, then going to T and pressing P.]
4) For those moves not mentioned in the manual, I have used literary
license to give them my own names.  If you have better suggestions,
email me.

Bad Mr. Frosty

Holds with brutal punch
Frozen Fist: D, DT, T&P
Ice Ball: A, DA, D, DT, T&P
Shoulder Charge: A, T&P
Snow Ball: hold A, T&P (can be done in midair)
Arcing Snowball: hold D, U&K
Foot Slide: D, DT, T&K
Flying Headbutt:  T, DT&P
Big Arm Sideswipe Hack [BASH]: hold D, U&P (three second charge)
[By far, the most damaging move in the game.]

Taffy

Throws with brutal kick, holds with brutal punch
Taffy Whack Punch: A, T&P
Taffy Whack Kick: A, T&K
Two-fisted Charge: hold A, T&P (can be done in midair)
Taffy Tornado: A, DA, D, DT, T&P
Aerial Tornado: T, DT&P
Dizzy Fake:  D, DA, A&P
[This makes Taffy pretend he's dizzy.  He recovers the instant
an attack button is pressed.  Don't ask me what this move is good
for, because I don't know.]

Tiny

Throws with brutal kick, holds with brutal punch
Sucker Punch: D, DT, T&P
Backfist Whip: D, DA, A&P
Medicine Ball: hold A, T&P (can be done in midair)
Arcing Ball: hold D, U&K
Air Tackle: ???
[Tiny jumps up with his fists extended and says "Whoosh".  It looks
like Tiny's light punch in midair, but it IS a special attack.
I know this because a CPU Tiny used it on me for a Super KO.  Anybody
else out there figured out this one?]

Blob

Holds with brutal punch
Vertical Clay Stomp: D&Brutal kick
Arcing Clay Stomp: T, DT&Brutal kick
[These are not, repeat NOT, special moves.  They do no damage if
blocked, and cannot be used for a Super KO.  They are listed here
because of the peculiar way they are done.  The vertical stomp
goes straight up and down; the arcing stomp does arc forward, but
only ever so slightly.]
Clay Spit: D, DT, T&P
Somersault Headbutt: D, DA, A&P
Slide Smack: A, DA, D, DT, T&K
Buzzsaw: hold A, T&P
Flying Roundhouse: A, T, D, DT&K
[This move must be done rather close to the opponent, otherwise
the backkick won't hit a thing.]

Blue Suede Goo

Throws with brutal kick
Humming Attack: D, DT, T&P
Hair Blade: D, DA, A&P
Hair Slice: T, DT, D&K
Song of Pain: A, DA, D, DT, T, A, DA, D, DT, T&K

Ickybod Clay

Throws with brutal kick, holds with brutal punch
Ecto Ball: D, DT, T&P
Ecto Punch: T, DT&P
Dart Dive: hold A, T&P (can be done in midair)
Teleport: P&K
[The attack buttons must be of the same strength.  The light attack
buttons will teleport you to the left side of the screen, the
medium attack buttons to the center, and the brutal attack buttons
to the right side.]

Helga

Throws with brutal kick, holds with brutal punch
Viking Ram: D, DT, T&P
Jumping Uppercut: D, DT, T&K
[This move cannot hit someone on the ground; the opponent must
be in midair.  Several people mentioned "Armpit of Doom" as an
alternate name for this move.  I didn't make this the official
name, but I thought it was at least worth mentioning.]
Yodel: hold A, DA, D, DT, T&P
Valkyrie's Ride: hold A, DA, D, DT, T&K

Bonker

Throws with brutal kick, holds with brutal punch
Flying Pie: D, DT, T&P
Cruising Pie: D, DT, T&K
Cutting Cartwheel: hold A, T&P
Clown Dive: hold D, U&P
Cream Spray: A, DA, D, DT, T&P
Aerial Shuffle [from ground]: A, DA, D, DT, T&K
Aerial Shuffle [from midair]: hold U, K (one second charge)
[Neither version of the aerial shuffle can hit someone on the
ground; the opponent must be in midair.]

CREDITS:
Special thanks to Christopher L. Schneider for Bonker's midair Aerial
Shuffle and for helping to make a correction to all T, D, DT moves.

	      the Zotmeister

P.S. One additional note:  someone told me several "special" moves of
Bonker's where his head pops out on a spring and where he hits his
opponent with a mallet.  [Sorry that I didn't reply directly to you,
whoever it was.]  These are not special moves, in that they do no damage
if blocked.  These are not special techniques, either, which require a
unique button/pad combination.  These are close-range moves, different
looking and different acting versions of standard attacks done when
standing near an opponent, but are still standard attacks.  For example,
Tiny's brutal punch usually has Tiny sticking both fists out at his
opponent, but when in close, he uses one fist to flatten his opponent so
hard the ground shakes.  Since these are not special moves or
techniques, they will not be placed on the list.  This list is for those
moves that require a special button/pad combination to execute which is
not apparent.

The island of Drakken is divided into four sections (Ice(1,5), swamp(2-6),
temperate(3-7), desert(4-8)); key: starting from top right castle, the
first number represents the right castle, and the second, the left castle.
The progression path is: 3,7,3,2,5,1,6,3,6,4,1,2,8,<>.
To enter castle 2 use the unlock spell.  To enter castle 3 when
there is a shark in the moat; wait until it swims to the right of
the drawbridge and then go across.  A good weapon for the mage and
cleric is the bow.  To get into castle 4 wait until dawn.

Final Fantasy II

General Combat Advice:
Never underestimate the value of casting BESRK and FAST on a 
character who inflicts a lot of hand-to-hand damage.  Especially 
against bosses.  Just don't let him get CHARMED.  :-)

You can safely cast CALL spells on a WALLed creature.
Failing this, cast WALL on a party member, and bounce the 
offensive spells off his WALL onto your opponent.  Spells only 
bounce once, thus will not reflect back in your face when you do 
this.

Rydia (your Caller) learns Meteo at level 60.

Some very rare items can be found by killing certain sets of 
monsters, and getting very lucky.  Supposedly POWER ARMOR is 
sometimes awarded as treasure if you defeat a pair of Behemoths. 
I've received an odd magical item that is just called "IMP", and 
seems to be unusable.  I got it by killing two Imps and a 
Swordrat in the Misty Cave.  I'm told you can use it to summon 
an Imp.  (If you know how to get any other odd items, please let 
me know and I'll list the information here.)

How to beat the Queen in the Land of Summoned Monsters
The difficulty in defeating the Queen is that she keeps curing 
herself. To defeat any enemy which does this, as soon as 
possible, cast WALL on the enemy so that attempts to CURE self 
will reflect to someone in your party.  Remember, once you WALL 
the Queen (or any enemy) DO NOT cast destructive magic spells on 
her, unless they are Caller spells.

How to beat the King in the Land of Summoned Monsters
Brute force.  Nothing special.  If you can't beat him, go get 
tougher and come back.  Having some things to DART at him will 
help.  Make sure to use group Cure3 or Cure4 spells.

How to beat Odin
Call LEVIA on him, but otherwise just use brute force.  
Lightning attacks seem to bring his wrath down upon you much 
more quickly than necessary. (It's suspected that the Odin spell 
fails against monsters with more than a certain number of hit 
points.  If you know for sure, please let me know.)

How to beat Bahamut
Call LEVIA against him, cast WHITE against him, DART Ninja 
Stars at him.

Methods for defeating Zeromus (the final boss)
(Combined suggestions from several people)

Beware, Zeromus tends to lash out with very powerful spells if 
you attack him with NUKE or WHITE.

Paladin:Attack, attack, attack....
Ninja:Automatically attacks with Berserk for a while, then 
Dart Ninja Stars.
Wh Wiz:Cast group-Cure4 every round. (Berserk the Ninja after 
the Paladin uses the Crystal.)
Bl Wiz:  Call Baham every round.
Dragoon:Jump every round unless he needs healing, in which case 
Attack.

Kain ( Dragoon )      : Jump w/ White spear
Rydia ( Caller )      : Bahamut, Bahamut, Bahamut
Cecil ( Paladin )     : Attack, Use Elixir, repeat
Rosa ( White Wizard ) : White Spell
Edge ( Ninja )        : "Dart" Excalibur, "Dart" Ninja stars

Cecil:  Straight ahead fight.
Kain:   Jump attack
Rydia:  Call Levia.  Call Asura instead, if needed.
Rosa:   Cast "Besrk" on Edge after Crystal used.
Cast "Life2" and "Cure4" the rest of the time.
Edge: Fights on "autopilot" ("Besrk") for a bit.  Then "Dart" 
anything you can.  If you run out of things to "Dart", 
Fight.

Cecil:  Attack, attack, attack....
Rydia:  Nuke, Nuke, Nuke....
Kain:   Jump, Jump, Jump....
Rosa:   Cure4, Cure4, Cure4....
Life2 on Cecil or Rydia if they die.
Edge:   Dart, Dart, Dart....

Mega tip
From: opferman@jupiter.fnbc.com
When your in battle, select any blank spot on your inventory and
select the weapon that your character is holding. Run away. Go to
EQUIP on the menu and equip the weapon you just unequipped. You now
have 2 of them! You can either sell them or save them.

Hints:
From: plg@diab.se (Patric Ljung)

Use stones and place them at sensors to keep doors open and lifts
in position. Throw a stone to distract aliens, giving you enough
room to kill em. Throwing a stone trigs some laser sensors, killing the
aliens and doing the job for you.

You never need to use a mechanical or exploding mouses. The transforming
aliens doesn't get hurt by an exploding mouse (doesn't explode).

There's only one time you really must use the tele receiver and the
tele transmitter, very shortly after you found it.
So you can use it to speed up your time to play the game. Avoid running
a long way back.

Make a roll under falling mines to get thru without getting hurt. May
fail some times. You might also make a roll thru 'electric barriers',
haven't been fried any time.

On level 4, after arriving with the taxi. Make your way thru by jumping
up on the building and to the rightmost screen. You don't get any 
further until you shoot the glass, at the top right.

On level 7? you start your way down. At the bottom, a man is locked
between two closed doors (mid level). On the level below a key and
a key lock is found, behind a closed door. The only way to open that
door is to shoot at it. (Very boring until I find that out)

Master Level
If you complete all five tracks in a grand prix at the expert 
level, you will be given the opportunity to race at Master 
Level.

Getting an early lead
Unless you drive the Golden Fox (yellow car), you can always get 
an initial speed increase by using the quick start (hold down 
the accelerator to full before start) and leaning to the right.  
By moving into the next car's "lane" you can force him to hit 
you from behind giving you a good push.  If you use the Fire 
Stingray (Pink), you can do this twice, first Blue Falcon will 
hit you then moving a little farther right, Wild Goose (Green) 
will hit you. This initial 2nd place position will enable you to 
take the lead rather quickly (beginner and standard levels).

bubbles)

Level 3 - (condition: must have destroyed all of the guns on the 
ground), fly up close to the low rock ceiling toward the end of 
the level right before the last "mountain".

difficult to explain location w/o picture).

Level 5 - (condition: unknown), fly through the fire at the 
corner of the inverted volcano just before the small passage

Super Code

1.   Start Game
2.   Up, Up, Down, Down, L, R, L, R, B, A, START
This will power up your ship with missiles, force field, all 
options, and more speed.  You can use this code once per level. 
Original Konami code for Gradius and LifeForce will cause 
GradiusIII ship to self-destruct. (Original code used Left and 
Right instead of L and R, if you're curious.)

Defeating Kaa the Snake:

They made Kaa way too tough for such an early boss. He's worse than
Louie! Here's a drawing of the boss area (use a monospaced font to
display).

+----------------+
|            1   |
|  3   4         |
| /     \    2   |
|0       ___  \  |
|_________|____O_|
+----------------+

Anyway, as soon as you enter the "room" move to the right corner. Kaa
should descend near the right side of the screen. (From point 1. If he's
facing the wrong way don't worry, he'll turn around.) Aim up and pelt
him with bananas. When he fires the hypnotic rays will go off the right
edge of the screen and not return, so hold your position and keep
racking up hits. He'll descend a little further and fire again, and you
might want to be on your guard this time because the rays won't
necessarily go off the screen edge. After this he'll rise back up,
descend once more, and do the same thing. 

When he rises the second time quickly move left (Near the hole marked
with a 3), duck, and fire bananas at the hole you were standing on.
(Marked with a 2.) Kaa will rise out of it. As he moves above the branch
(4) you might use some papayas or mangoes on him if you still have any;
they hit much harder. He will stop after he's about an inch above the
branch. Quickly retreat further to the left and jump to avoid the
straight-line beam he fires. Hit him a few times as he retreats into
hole 2. 

Next stand on the branch (4) and fire towards the left; he'll be coming
out of hole (3). Once he stops moving jump to avoid another
straight-line beam and resume firing as he retreats.

By this time he's probably mad and will whip his tail from hole (3)
while rising out of hole (2), or vice-versa. You'll need to jump onto
the branch (4), hit him as much as you can, and jump when he fires. If
he descends from above, move to the far right and fire upwards as you
did before.

Defeating Louie, King of the Apes:

You'll have to fight this guy twice. The first time is easy. There will
be three band members on a platform above you. Hit each of them with a
banana and they will start playing. When you have all three going Louie
will start dancing, and you can get free hits on him. You may have to
stop hitting him a couple times to keep the band going.

The second time you won't have this advantage, and will have to rely on
reflexes. Just stay as far away from him as possible and hit him with
whatever weapons you have. When he jumps to grab onto the underside of
the platform, you should jump as well, and the coconuts are relatively
easy to jump over. When he charges jump over him, move to the opposite
side of the screen, and continue hitting him.

Lagoon

Defeat End Boss (almost)
From:DELOURA@PMEL.NOAA.GOV

The bird in Lagoon is easier to defeat (in fact, VERY easy!)
if you know one thing about the way the game works.

When your character is JUMPING, he is invincible.  You can
attack while you're jumping.

So the way to fight the bird is to stand in a place where the
bird would come by at regular intervals, and when he gets close,
jump and swing the sword as fast as you can.  Repeat.  Heal
when necessary.  Simple.

The Bird, however, is *not* the final Boss.

Three Tower Puzzle
To be able to proceed to Elfrea, you must first solve the Three
Tower Puzzle.  You will be told that the order to complete the
Towers is Blue Green Red.  This does not mean that you must
explore the Towers in that order, but rather the order to place
the colored Jade stone on the corresponding Pedestal.

Explore the Blue Tower and find the Green Jade.  Explore the
Green Tower and find a broken Red Sapphire.  Explore the Red
Tower and defeat the Ghost.  After the Ghost is defeated a new
are in the basement will reveal the Green Jade.  Now return to
the Cave near Medan and talk to the Old Man in the Cave.  He will
give you access to his Treasure Room where you will find the Red
Sapphire which is has hidden for safe keeping.  Now return to the
Towers in the order specified (Blue Green Red).  Find the Blue
Pedestal in the Blue Tower and use the Blue Jade, then Green,
then Red.  When the Red Sapphire has been put in place, you will
be teleported to Elfrea.

the Pirate Tower is:
*------*
| 1  4 |
|      |

Tip
On the Mario Circuit 2 course (last course in the Mushroom Cup), 
get a mushroom.  As you approach the jump, use the mushroom.  
This will give you some added speed as you hit the jump.  Pull 
hard to the left as you go over the jump.  If you timed it 
right, your racer will go flying off the screen and land right 
in front of the finish line.

Mario World, Super

1-Up Blocks - In the five tiered 1-Up chambers, Mario can collect all 5
1-Ups if he uses his cape.  Spin jump and hit the lower corner of each
block with the cape.  The first two block in each row yield coins, the
third will yield a 1-Up.

Remember that pressing START followed by SELECT will drop you back to
the map screen, if you've completed the level before.  Handy for collecting
a needed powerup near the start of a nearby level.

Berries for Yoshi - 10 Red Berries will cause an egg to hatch into a
Super Mushroom.  2 Pink Berries will cause an egg to hatch into coins.
3 Green Berries will add 20 seconds to the timer.

Yoshi and Shells - If Yoshi spits out a Blue or Green Shell before
swallowing it, it can be reused.

Yoshi and P-Switches - After stomping a P-Switch, use Yoshi to pick it
up.  When Yoshi spits it back out, it will again be reusable.

Mario can take a direct hit from any creature if riding Yoshi.

Mario can hold 2 items at once by stacking one on the other then
picking up both.

Magic Number 1-Up - If the tens digit of the star bonus achieved by
breaking the goal post tape matches both the ones and the tens digit
of the time remaining on the timer, you will earn a 1-Up.  (seems like
a lot more trouble than it's worth)

Top Secret Area - Get a cape.  Enter the first ghost house and walk to
the right until the first hole in the floor.  Hold the Y button to spin.
Run to the left until able to fly, jump and fly up the left hand wall 
until you can land on a ledge to your right.  Run all the way across 
the house, off the ledge, and out the door at the end.  Once you exit,
you will have a path to an area where you can fully power up, get a
Yoshi, and reenter for as many 1-UPs as you want (1 at a time).

Bonus Items - At the end of every world, carry a turtle shell, P-block,
or an enemy through the high bar.  It will turn into a power-up item
that you can use in the next world.

Get Back Into Castles - To reenter castles once you have destroyed them,
press the 'L' and 'R' buttons at the same time while standing on
the site of the castle.

Just what is the utility of a Firey Mario in SMW? - 3 of the
Koopalings can be beaten by fireballs.  Hit Morton, Ludwig, or Roy 12
times w/ fireballs and they are history.  This is particularly useful
against Morton and Roy who move pretty fast once you get them upset.

In Chocolate Island 1 there is a 3-Up Moon just beyond the midway
gate, but to get it you must pickup and carry the springboard which is
left of the midway gate (means you cannot reach the tape to break it).
Carry the springboard to the level area left of the big crescent-shaped
section.  If you jump as high as possible and then go right while in 
the air, you can land on a set of clouds where the moon is.

If you don't use the angled green pipe to launch Mario forward in
Chocolate Island 1, then you will not get a midway gate.

Power-Ups Between Stages - Carry a P-Switch or a Koopa Shell through an
exit gate and the power-up item in the reserve box will transform as
follows:

How to beat AWESOME (in special world)

Here's how to beat AWESOME without having to worry with jumping on koopas
and bullets and all those nasty things at the end:

1. The goal is to cross the whole section at the end (where all the fish,
bullets, etc start coming at you like crazy) using a flying blue yoshi.

2. You may get blue yoshis very easily down on starworld 2 or 3 (the one under
water where the egg hatches -- small blue yoshi will eat a power star and
immediately turn into big blue yoshi.  At this point, press pause-select
to get out.

3. The hardest part is probably getting blue yoshi in AWESOME over to the
last pipe before the nasty section.  Once you get him there, try to eat one
of the turtle shells and/or turtles.  BUT HERE IS THE TRICK:  You will never
make it over the gorge to the end by flying at normal speed.  You have to fly
fast just as you would run fast by holding the Y button down, while flapping
"your wings" with the B button.  But watch out, if you press the Y-button AFTER
you eat a shell, yoshi will spit it out.  You must press Y before eating the
shell, and never let up again until you get to the end.  Flap like crazy and
you will make it over the gorge.

How to beat Funky in the Special World

Ah, this was truly a nasty level. Get equipped with a Yoshi and a Cape from
the level two spaces to the right. Then, at the very beginning, run to one
block before you meet the first wiggly, then fly with Yoshi. When it looks
like you're coming down, DON'T let go of any buttons. You will
automatically get kicked further by the bullets firing off the canons. Keep
this up till you reach the springboard next to two pipes.

Then, the procedure I followed to carry the springboard to the next pipe
was to first swallow the wiggly in the next area, pick up the springboard,
run with it, jump, etc....

This level gets my vote for MOST ANNOYING.  Especially when that idiotic
Yoshi runs away so many times. Talk about loyalty!

Favorite 1-Up tricks

For someone who hasn't advanced far in SMW, the easiest source of
one-ups is Yoshi's Island 2.  Enter with Yoshi, then bumping the block
that normally gives Yoshi gives a one-up.  Use START and SELECT to
jump out of the course and repeat as often as desired.  It is a little
faster if Mario is caped and you enter at the middle of Yoshi's Island
2.  Then one can get a life every 10 seconds or so with no skill
required.  I generally run it up to the maximum of 99 lives in order
to pay for the increasingly long trip back to Yoshi's Island.

Go to Chocolate Island 4 in world 6.  You must have a
cape.  Get the first P-block and go down the grey tube.  Once in the
tube, grab the second P-block and jump off the edge.  Hug the right
wall until you see the seventh opening in the wall that is filled with
1-UP mushrooms.  Float into the passage and grab the 1-UPs.  When you
come out of the tube, go back to the left and repeat as many times as
needed.

Just before entering the last area of Vanilla Secret Fortress (to face
Reznor), you can earn many 1-Ups by repeatedly stomping the Bony Beetles
at the Red Door (don't touch the ground - tread water).  At first this
will just earn points, but the points increase and eventually become
1-Ups.  This basic technique applies most places where an enemy can be
continually stomped w/o touching the ground.

In Butter Bridge 2, there is one green pipe with a small log platform
on both sides (this is about 2/3 of the way through, also it's the
pipe you come back up through if you go down the second purple pipe
to ride the rope).  If you have a cape (there is a feather in the
green "!" block right after the middle goal), get on the right log
platform trapping the koopa between you and the green pipe.  Now, you
can use the cape spin trick to continuously knock the koopa shell
against the pipe to collect unlimited 1-Ups until the clock runs out.


There's a place where you can get unlimited lives
(well, I guess up to 100, I never actually saw how far I could go) in the
Sunken Ghost ship. Just before you enter the pipe to go the second portion
of the ship, go to the left and up. There will be two bullet things that
will keep shooting and they will hit your feet. First, you get 200, 400,
800, ...., up to 8000, then you get 1-ups for every hit. So, I just sit
there for a minute and rack up lives.

In the Forest of Illusion (one of the acts on the left.) there is
an act where there is a koopa "fishing" with a green mushroom. Ignore him.
Get a shell and run to where you find the first pipe. There is a monster
that comes out of the pipe and throws creatures at you. There is a depression
in front of the pipe. Take the shell and throw it at the pipe, it will start
to bounce back and forth. Everytime the guy in the pipe throws a creature
the bouncing shell will kill it. Further, you can now "take the bait" from
the guy in the cloud. He will also throw more creatures giving you more guys.
It is possible to get 40-70 guys (depending on how good you are at getting
the guy in the cloud to constantly throw in the depression) in one play of
the scene.


Go to the first world in the forest (the one next to the  Ghost
House). Play through that World and touch the midway goal (the small goal
post, ya know what I mean, right?). Then exit the world (start to pause,
select to bail).
Now go back into the world. You'll start at the midway post. Run to the
right and you'll find a block that alternates between the different pow up-s
in the game. Hit the block when it's a feather and you'll catch the invinc
star. Now run to the right and hit every monster along the way. Soon, you'll
start to earn 1-Ups and 2-Ups (from the centipede-like creatures). You should
be able to get 15 lives or more before the star fizzes out.

In regards to extra lives, I found the best way is using (as someone
else mentioned) the star.  I use the 5th special world (I'm pretty sure
it's the 5th), I'm not sure what it's name is, but I can tell you that it
is the one on ice, with lots of Rex's.  What you want to do is go until
you get to the platform that has 5 coins and a ?-box above it.  You must
carry the Power button with you to this point.  Hit the P, and get the star
from the ?-box.
Then jump up and down and touch all the cheep-cheep's that are flying back
and forth.  When the P-power ends, and you fall (because the ledge turns
back into coins) run to the left and kill everybody in your path.  I can
consistently get 17-20 lives from using this method.

This is the 1-up method I use.  You get 40-50 lives, a power-up,
and a Yoshi all at once.  I kinda like it, and you are welcome to add
it to the list if you don't have it already.
In Vanilla Secret 2, go to the midway tape.  Break the tape and leave
the world.  Go back in the world, starting at midway.  Go right, until
you come to a pipe.  In a music box above the pipe is a power-up.
Continue right, avoiding paratroopers and spiked guys, over the
chasm, and to the row of blocks above a field of spiked turtles.
Hit the bottom of the SECOND block in that row.  It is over the spiked
turtles, but with minimal practice you can hit it easily.  In the
SECOND block is a P-Block.  DON'T JUMP ON IT!  Grab it, and take it with
you.  While carrying the P-Block, return back to your left, over the
chasm, past the pipe you saw before, and past the midway tape.  Continue
until you get BETWEEN 2 pipes on the same screen.  Each pipe has a
villian jumping out of it, and there is a chasm just to the left of
the left pipe.  Set the P-Block down here.
Jump on the P-Block, jump over the chasm on the left, and run as far
and as fast as you can left.  Each turtle/villian has turned into a
coin, and after ~5 of them they are all 3-ups.  Tons of 'em.
The P-Block power will run out about the time you get back to the Yoshi
block.  Get Yoshi, and leave the world.  ***NOTE: Don't leave the world
until the game has finished counting up your lives!!!!  You get so many
you have to wait till it counts em all.  Voila!  Many lives and a Yoshi.

Hints and Tips
From: deloura@pmel.noaa.gov (Robert DeLoura)

Recently, I saw a posting by someone who was explaining how to do the Powered
Horizontal Jump with Samus.  I do it a different way, so I thought I'd post
another explanation of it.

First, just to make sure we're all talking about the same thing, I'll explain
how to do a Powered *Vertical* Jump.  (Anyone who's finished the game has
probably seen this done by the bird.)  I believe you need the Speed Booster
item before you can do these moves:

* Hold down your DASH button, and run in some direction
until Samus starts to glow and leave a trail.

* When you get close to the place you want to jump from,
push DOWN on the control pad.  Then release the DASH button
and control pad.

* Samus is now glowing.  You have a couple of seconds (maybe 4-5)
to move around before the glow wears off.

* Before the glow wears off, hit JUMP.  You'll do a Powered Vertical
Jump, which will send you through any blocks marked with the 'speed
booster' symbol.  You'll keep going straight up til you run out of
energy, or hit something.  Don't forget that you burn off energy
at a rather high rate while performing this type of jump.

Ok, now I can assume that you know how to do a Powered *Vertical* Jump.
There are a couple of places in the game where it would be nice to be able to
perform a Powered *Horizontal* Jump, dashing across the screen very quickly
in one particular direction.  Here's how you do it:

* Do the first three steps outlined above.  Now you're glowing.

* Go to the place where you want to make a horizontal jump.  Keep
in mind you've only got a couple of seconds, but this is enough
time to shoot a door open and go through, or something similarly
quick.

* Face the direction you want to jump in.

* Hit the JUMP button, and then IMMEDIATELY push the control pad in the
direction you are facing (the way you want to jump).  ZOOM!
A Powered Horizontal Jump.

There's a third type of jump similar to these.  This is a Powered *Diagonal*
Jump, which goes both UP and in the direction you're facing, at roughly a
45-degree angle.

* Do the first three steps in order to make Samus glow.

* Go to the place you want to jump from, before the glow wears off.

* Face the horizontal direction you want to move in.  In other words,
if you want to jump Up+Left, face Left.  If you want to jump
Up+Right, face Right.

* Hit the JUMP button, and then IMMEDIATELY push the button you use
to point your weapon diagonally upwards.  By default, this is the R
button on top of the controller.  Off you go... on a Powered
Diagonal Jump.

If the diagonal one doesn't quite work for you, I may have the ordering wrong.
Try holding the R button down before you hit JUMP, in that case.

Just in case you don't know of any good places to try out your new toys,
here's a good spot for the Powered Horizontal Jump.  Go to Norfair, and head
over to the left side of the map.  Find the room that is 1 square wide and
4 squares high on the map, with entrances on the right side of the top and
bottom squares.  This room has a bunch of platforms that are two units wide,
and they're all built of the rock type that collapses when you touch it (so
you tend to fall all the way to the bottom of the room when you enter, since
everything collapses under you).  Those little orange spiky monsters are here
too, clinging to the platforms.

Well, you probably fell to the bottom of the shaft the first time you reached
the room, so get back up to the top in some way.  You could triangle jump,
or use Space Jump, or just walk around until you reach the door again.  Enter
more carefully this time, so you don't fall immediately when you come through
the door.

Use your X-ray device on the opposite wall.  See those Missiles hidden in the
wall?  Shoot at the wall and you can get a better look at them, though the
wall closes up again very soon thereafter.  You don't have much time to reach
them after breaking open the wall.

You could try using Space Jump -- shoot the wall open, then Space Jump across
the room and grab them.  I had some trouble with that, though.  A flashier way
to get them involves the Powered Horizontal Jump.

Retreat back into the room that is connected to the top of this shaft.  (Go
back out the door, I mean. :-) )  Clear all the critters from the room, and
go stand on the far right side.  Now do a DASH all the way across the room,
pushing down just before the door in order to make Samus glow.  Shoot the door
open, and step carefully through.

Now you're standing on a tiny bit of ledge.  Fire at the far wall to reveal the
Missiles (or you can shoot them after you jump across, if you're fast).  Hit
JUMP, and immediately press LEFT on the control pad.  ZOOM!  A Powered
Horizontal Jump, which puts you in the perfect place to grab the Missiles.
=============================
Those obnoxious heads that spit fireballs... you know, those ones in the lava
pit on the way to Ridley (in Norfair)?  The pit you have to use Space Jump to
get out of?  Some of those heads can be destroyed.  The ones in the lava pit
seem to be invulnerable, but the ones that occur elsewhere are not.  One good
Power Bomb will generally kill them.  That's only marginally useful -- it's
usually just as easy to zap them with the Ice Beam and avoid them.  

However... there's something behind at least one of them.  :-)
(If you want specifics, email me.  That way I don't completely spoil it for
people who want to find it themselves.)


Further info... in the part of Norfair that leads to Ridley, there are at 
least *TWO* walls that show up as being solid to the X-ray device... even
though they aren't!

How many people out there are stuck trying to figure out how to reach those
bloody Power Bombs in the Ridley area of Norfair that looks like this?

  +-------------------------+

I know *I* was stuck for a long time.  It'd be so easy to get them if you
could enter through the top entrance, right?  But you just *can't* find it?
Go back out through the left door.  See that wall across from you?  It isn't
really there.  Walk through it.  There are three powerup items hidden in that
area (including that set of Power Bombs), so search carefully.

If you're still missing an energy tank, there's one in the Ridley area of
Norfair.  Perhaps after having read the earlier tips in this message, you'll
now be able to find it.  It was the last one I found.

If you're missing a different one, or have noticed some obnoxious missile
powerups in Crateria that you can't seem to reach, you might consider taking
a little spin-jump up the left wall of the area your spaceship starts in.
Bring the Screw Attack powerup.  You could also try a leap at DASH speed from
the top of a conveniently-placed platform....

Freeze Trick
------------
To freeze an enemy dead in their tracks, jump kick over them so
that they block, then keep flipping over them again and again.
They should stop swaying back and forth. When they do, land, and 
they will start to sway again, but won't attack, walk, or even turn
around. This works with all fighters, but only on the computer.

Reptile
-------
To get to reptile, fight your way to the pit, then get a Double
Flawless without blocking (or even using the button). There is an
exception on the blocking rule when it is used in a fatality (which
you also must perform).

'Logbook Entry' screen: 6_KjG RVGG! yBgMR %_G:: v>G=_ GRPG_ ?.
This code will not work, which is the purpose of it. Then,
without deleting the non-functional password, back up to the very
beginning of the page using the arrows at the bottom of the
screen. After you do this, type in the following password over
the previous one: rzT$> L1>X9 q+TD_ ZR>?? q/>zD >_H>z :.  This
will now start you off at level 9, but only Kid Ying will be on
the screen. Press the A button on controller 2 and you will see
that Dr. Yang is completely powered up.

Powerups

The following Powerups are to be performed at the "Tonight's 
Match-up Screen.  When you are instructed to hold a button, you can 
either release it when the screen is blank or when the court appears.

Powerup Fire:  
Press B seven times, then hold Y, B, and Up.  This allows 
your player to be on fire for the entire game.

Powerup Dunks:  
If you have a burning desire to jam from just beyond half 
court, try this.  While rotating the directional pad 360 
degrees (clockwise), press B thirteen times and hold B 
on the thirteenth button press.

Powerup Defense:  
This enables your player to goal tend without penalty.  
Press B five times, and hold on the fifth button press.

Shooting Percentage:  
When you do this trick, the clock will show the 
percentage of your shot.  This helps in finding 
player's best spots for threes.  While holding 
down, tap B once, then hold A and B.

Powerup Intercept:  
This Powerup is basically useless, at least in my 
experience.  While rotating the pad clockwise, tap B.
Keep rotating and tapping until the court appears.

Powerup Turbo:
Unlimited turbo for the entire game.  Press B five times,   
then hold Y, B, and A.

Juice Mode:  
This makes the speed of game play double.  After you get 
used to it, you may never want to play at regular speed again.
Press any button thirteen times, then hold B and X.

Password with Juice Mode:  Use this password to automatically start every 
game in juice mode.  Initials HRY:  QF3B43T/QJY55TF (86-0).

Bonus Stages
Get to bonus stages by accomplishing special maneuvers on the 
Rocketbelt and Parachute rounds.  Ignore the rings and other 
objectives in these rounds and maneuver over the moving platform in 
each level.  If you can land on this portion of the target area, you 
will be taken to the bonus stage with a rating of 100 points.

When using the rocketbelt, you will be transformed into a winged man. 
While winged, try to jump onto the trampolines and hit the power P's 
before landing in the middle of the target.  When using the 
parachute, you will be transformed into a penguin who must high dive 
into a multi-point pool.  The waters are separated by ropes which 
each designate different extra point values.

HINTS on landing on moving platforms:

Land on moving platform with the parachute (level one): immediately 
rotate 90 degrees right when released (ignore rings). hold position 
until 630-40 feet, at which time pull rip-cord and then pull a quick 
u-turn (180 degrees).  at 225 feet, rotate 90 degrees right and line 
up with the moving platform track.  when you reach the track the 
platform should pass underneath you and then return underneath you 
(traveling the same direction as you) -- as soon as you see it flare 
and hold.

Land in the water target with the hang-glider:
hit thermal and wait till the glider levels out.  push up (dive) and 
right, drop to 150 feet, pull up and line up with the target. obtain 
level flight and flare repeatedly just before the shadow hits the 
bottom edge of the target (not much, you should be no higher than 25 
feet).

Land on the moving platform with the rocket-pack:
practice using the low burner and holding at 10 feet.  then practice 
stabilizing your position after moving forward (tricky). complete the 
course and stabilize yourself over the platform's path in a place 
where you can see it approaching (at a corner or end of the 'track').  
drop like a rock the moment the edge of the platform hits your 
shadow.

Ranma 1/2 (SFC)

I'm going to use different spellings for the character names here, because
the ones used on the cart annoy me.  (I'm a big fan of the animated show.)

CART SAYS      I SAY
Ryohga              Ryouga
Kohchoh             Kouchou
Happy               Happosai
Kunoh               Kunou
Colon               Cologne

Debug Mode - ATS, hold L and R down, and then press Start.  Keep holding
L and R.  A list of options should appear, and now you can release L and
R.  You can use this to set up any fight combination you'd like -- any
character vs any character, run by your choice of human or computer.  Even
computer vs computer, if you'd like.  However, the computer doesn't know how
to fight as Happosai or Cologne, so if you pick a computer-controlled
version of either, it'll just stand there and let you beat on it.  You
can also play around with the strength of the characters from this menu.
If you hit SELECT, the background will change.  Whatever background is
on the menu when you hit START will be the background you'll fight on.
There are easier ways to play char-vs-char and such, so read on....

Playing as someone other than Ranma in 1-player mode - hold L and R down
on Controller 1, and you can push Left and Right to pick any normal
character that you'd like (not Happosai or Cologne, though).  You can
change characters every time you see the character selection screen (you
aren't stuck with the same character against each opponent).  You can also
use this to allow Player 1 to be a non-Ranma character in Duel mode
(player-vs-player).  See the next hint if you want to be the same character
as your opponent (in either mode), though....

Playing as the same character as your opponent - the person on Controller
1 must hold down L and R (boy, that sounds familiar) when you hit a button
to start the match.  If you don't do this, the game will beep at you as
if your choice of match-up was illegal.

Other Difficulty Levels - From the options screen, press L, then R, then
SELECT.  There will now be two more difficulty levels you can scroll
through, in red text.  One seems just a bit harder than EASY, the other
just a bit easier than SUPER.

General Computer Advice - Play Ranma-chan.  Half the characters are easily
defeatable by waiting in defensive crouch for them to jump in on you, then
quickly standing and doing your A-button special attack.  (Genma, Ryouga,
and usually Shampoo).  Defeat Kouchou by luring him into throwing a
pineapple and double-jumping over it (don't jumpkick him) to throw him.
Kunou is a sucker for repeated throws (throw him, rush over to him while
he's getting up and throw him again as he stands, repeat), all you have to
do is get in on him *one* time. 

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Ranma 1/2, Part 2 (SFC)
Ranma 1/2 (SNES)

****  Important Note -  The following is for both the
SFC Ranma 1/2, Part 2 and also the SNES Ranma 1/2 **** 

Configuration Code
1.   On Continue Screen
2.   Press and Hold R X and A
3.   Continue Holding until next match begins
4.   Configuration Screen will appear

The characters in this game, clockwise from the top of the selection screen,
are:
Ranma-kun (male)
Ranma-chan (female)
Akane
Shampoo
Mousse
Ukyou
Panda (Genma, Ranma's father)
Gosunkugi
Gambler King
Ryouga
In Duel mode, you can also choose Pansuto Tarou (human or minotaur form).
Normally, you have to win a game (at any difficulty level) against the
computer in order to use Tarou in the Scenario mode.

By default, Y is your Light attack button, B is your Heavy attack button.

Using Heavy Attacks and Charging a move at the same time -- if you define
more than one button as your Heavy attack, you can hold one of them down
to charge, and use the other to attack with.

Better throw damage -- most characters do more damage if they throw their
opponent over their heads.  (If your opponent is on your right, throw them
to your left.)  Gosunkugi and Happosai are the exceptions -- they do more
damage with the Heavy attack button, regardless which direction they throw.

Reducing throw damage (this is documented) if you hit the attack buttons
with the right timing after being thrown, you will land on your feet and
take about half normal damage from the throw.  If you can describe exactly
when to hit the button, let me know.

Ranma-kun, Ranma-chan, and Shampoo can double-jump -- when at the peak of
their jump, hit X a second time for more height.  Shampoo can steer herself
anywhere on the screen if you use this.  Ranma-chan just comes down really
fast.  (Happosai can double-jump too, actually.)

Moves List:  Here's a description of all of the special moves (other than
throws and "normal" moves that just involve hitting a button at the right
distance).  'CHARGE' means to hold down a Heavy attack button for a second
or two, then release it and point in the direction given.  (CHARGE, then
DOWN, means to hold it for a few seconds, then push DOWN on the direction
pad and release the Heavy attack button.)

RANMA (both)
------------
KAITEN KICK         CHARGE, then DOWN.
(A rolling kick, longer range with higher CHARGE)
(As Ranma-chan, this is a rolling elbow move instead)

FUMITSUKE      Jump towards your opponent, then press DOWN and B.
(A head-stomp move)

HIRYUU SHOUTENHA    Press Y and B at the same time.
(Hurricane Punch, a little like a dragon punch)

MOUKO TAKABISHA          CHARGE, then TOWARDS or AWAY from your opponent.
It goes towards them either way.
(An explosion of blue [or yellow, if Ranma-chan]
energy appears directly in front of you.  Longer
CHARGE time = bigger explosion)

KACHUU TENSHIN AMAGURIKEN     Press Y or B rapidly.
(A fast-hands move, like E. Honda's 100-hands punch
in SF2)

RYOUGA
------

KASA TSUKI          TOWARDS and B.
(Pokes an umbrella at your opponent)

TOBI KASA TSUKI          JUMP TOWARDS, then press DOWN and B.
(Comes down on their heads with your umbrella)

SHISHI HOUKOUDAN    Y and B at the same time.
(An explosion of energy appears before you, like
a full-strength version of Ranma's MOUKO TAKABISHA
move.)

BAKUSAI TENKETSU    CHARGE, then DOWN.
(The 'exploding point' technique.  Rocks roll along
the ground at your opponent, CHARGE=Range)

BANDANA NAGE        CHARGE, then TOWARDS or AWAY.
(Throws bandannas at your opponent.  CHARGE=Number.)

SHAMPOO
-------

KAKATO OTOSHI       JUMP TOWARDS, then push DOWN and B.
(Head stomp)

RYOUGA RETSUSHOU KYAKU   Y and B at the same time.
(Leaps into the air feet-first, to the top of the
screen, then comes back down.)

MOUGEKI TOTSUJINHA  CHARGE, then TOWARDS or AWAY.
(Rushes at your opponent with Chinese maces.
CHARGE=Distance)

AKANE
-----

NIDAN MAWASHI GERI  TOWARDS opponent and B.
(Two high kicks)

SHOUMAKUUHAKEN      Y and B at the same time.
(A leaping uppercut.  A Dragon Punch, plain and
simple.  She's not invulnerable in it, though.)

SHIPPU BAKURETSUKEN CHARGE, then TOWARDS or AWAY.
(Rushes at your opponent with fist out.  CHARGE
affects distance.)

PANDA (GENMA)
-----

CHICHI NO IKARI
(OSHIOKIHEN)        Y and B at the same time, from throw range.
(Genma bounces on his opponent.  Nearly half a bar of
damage!)

CHICHI NO IKARI
(TAIBATSUHEN)       CHARGE, then TOWARDS or AWAY.
(A rush-at.  CHARGE=Distance.)

PANDA HYAKURETSUKEN Y or B, quickly and repeatedly.
(A "100-hands" move, like Ranma's TENSHIN AMAGURIKEN.
Seems more effective with B.)

GOSUNKUGI
---------

DAIKAITEN WARANINGYOU    Y and B at the same time.
(Spins around twice with a large voodoo doll in his
hands.)

WARANINGYOU NAGE    CHARGE, then TOWARDS or AWAY.
(Looks just like DAIKAITEN WARANINGYOU, but he throws
the doll afterwards.)

UKYOU
-----

KONJOU GIRI         B and TOWARDS.
(Looks just like B, to me.  A long-range swing with
her big spatula.)

TENKASU KANSHAKUDAMA MIKKSU
CHARGE, then DOWN.
(Throws some exploding mix at the opponent.)

KOHERA NAGE         CHARGE, then TOWARDS or AWAY.
(Throws spatulas at the opponent.  CHARGE=Number)

MOUSSE
------

KATANA              B and TOWARDS.
(Extends several long blades from the arm of his robe)

KEIRANKEN      CHARGE, then TOWARDS or AWAY.
(Throws exploding eggs at the opponent.  CHARGE=Number)

HYAKURETSU ANKI          Y or B, quickly and repeatedly.
(A fast-hands move, but with ranged weapons from
the arm of his robe.)

TAKATSUMEKEN        JUMP, then DOWN and B.
(Comes down from his jump with claws extended from
his feet, which can hit the opponent.)

GAMBLER KING
------------

TEN BOW             CHARGE, then TOWARDS or AWAY.
(Fires something at the opponent from a bow.)

JOKER SHOWER        JUMP AWAY, then DOWN and B.
(Throws some cards diagonally down, forward.  Only
useful if the opponent is close or chasing you.)

-------------

SUKASHIKI KIKKU          JUMP, then DOWN and B.
(A head-stomp)

SENPORAKU      B and TOWARDS.
(Swings some pantyhose at his opponent.  That's
what the 'PANSUTO' in his name means.)

IPPATSU GYAKUTEN OTOKOGERI
Y and B at the same time.
(Leaps at the opponent, feet first, but with his
leading foot on fire.)

PANSUTO TAROU (AKUMA)
-------------

MOUGYUU TOTSUSHIN   CHARGE, then TOWARDS or AWAY.
(Charges at his opponent.  CHARGE=Distance)

JET ATTACK          JUMP, then DOWN and B.
(Comes down at his opponent, diagonally, from his
jump... with his fist outstretched.)

Debug Mode -
Pick any two characters.  When you reach the screen that asks you to pick
a background to fight on, press the R, X, and A keys, simultaneously, on
controller one.  Hold them.  A menu screen should come up in a few seconds.
You are now in DEBUG mode.  Enjoy.  (You can play Happosai from here.
He has two CHARGE moves.  One is DOWN (Happodaikarin, he throws
firecrackers), the other is TOWARDS/AWAY, where he shoots a blue fireball.
He also has a Y+B move that makes him grow large for a few seconds.)

Fighting vs the Computer in DUEL and TEAM modes -
If you hold down the L and R buttons on the Character Selection screen,
you can move the other player's character-selection box.  Hitting the Y
button with the L and R buttons held down will select the character for
your opponent, but it will be controlled by the computer, at whatever
difficulty level you currently have the game set to.

The next two are ones that I posted to the net before, but don't remember
"for sure" at the moment, so I'll mark them as unverified until I'm sure
they are correct here.  If these are wrong, try reversing the direction of
the circle on the directional keypad. (go UP, LEFT, DOWN, RIGHT, UP instead
of what I have here)  You may need to do these after hitting START at the
title screen.  (So you have the 'scenario/duel/team/option' menu visible.)

Playing as Pansuto Tarou without winning a Scenario Mode game first -
UP, RIGHT, DOWN, LEFT, UP, X, SELECT, from the title screen.  You should
hear Ranma-kun yell out.  Now Tarou will be an option in Scenario Mode.

Looking at the visuals without playing the game -
Reverse the code for playing as Pansuto Tarou.  (SELECT, X, UP, LEFT....)
Again, do this at the title screen.  If you do it right, the final UP will
bring a line of text onto the screen that has the name of a character
followed by OP or ED.  OP is their Opening animation, and ED is their
EnDing animation (when they win the game).  There's another, but I don't
remember what the game calls it at the moment.

Rival Turf

Secret Warp Trick - To do this, you must have 30 or more defeated
enemies, represented by small heads that appear above your energy
meter. (The number 10 represents 10 enemies.) Once you get to the
part of the fourth level where there is a door, press UP at the
first door to go into it. You will warp to the end of level 4 to
face the boss.

Change Character Names - To do the trick, you must first play
through the game and get the high score of that game. When the
screen comes up to enter your name, put in CHRCONF as your name,
and you will be brought to a character configure screen that will
allow you alter the name of all the characters in the game. Once
you press START for a game with your new characters.

Tips - gt7303b@prism.gatech.EDU (Troy Lee)

Level 1-  Wait on the closer platform and a boulder will pass just 
beneath your feet.  Jump and get right in front of the platform and 
start pecking the base.  If you jumped at the right boulder, the 
catapult will not come all the way down and hit you *once*, the next 
time around it will.  Wait until it is about to hit and use your 
turbo to escape.  The thing will fall apart after doing this about 4 
times.

Level 2-  The only way I can get past this is a suicide approach. You 
have knock out 6 rivits while avoiding the crane.  I just don't 
bother to avoid it.  Time your entry so you will have some time to 
peck at the rivits and knock them out as fast as you can.  Then do 
the same to the other side.  I almost always beat him, but you 
probably won't have any energy left when you're done.

Level 3-  This one is easy but it takes forever.  You have to peck at 
the bombs he throws onto the train, then they will bounce off and hit 
him if you time it right.  Watch out for the middle of the two cars 
you are jumping around on because you can fall through the gap.  
Everytime you score a hit, A volley of bombs will come flying down.  
I can't remeber the overall pattern, but it only takes a second to 
figure out.

Level 4-  This is just a simple test of reflexes.  Jump to the top of 
the contraption he's riding around in (use the drills to get up 
there). Now you have to peck away the 'tiles' that make up the top of 
this thing (not that it makes much sense why this is bad). You can 
only peck a 'tile' when the corresponding platform raises up to try 
to smash you into the roof.  I just kinda randomly moved around, 
falling off platforms when I was on one that started to rise, and 
pecking under any raised platforms I happened to be next to at that 
moment.

Level 5- Sorry, but I've only gotten to 5-1.  I lost about 10 men 
here, Made it past a particulary tricky part on my last man, and then 
just fell into the bottom of the screen when I missed a platform.  
Instead of smashing the damn game into little bits like I should 
have, I let a friend borrow it for a while and couldn't care less if 
he ever brings it back.  This game is more annoying than trying to 
get a pinfall on the Great Puma on Pro Wrestling for the NES.

Rock'n Roll Racing Hints & Passwords
From: KOLBUSHR.DIALOGIC@pobox.dialogic.com (Kolbush, Richard)

To repeat a hint given a few times already, it is a good idea to
let the competition get ahead at the start of the race. A few
seconds is generally a safe estimate.  Then catch up to them
and they will already be damaged, making it easier for you to
destroy them and take the lead.  As you progress to higher
levels, the amount of time you give them to get ahead at the
start should be less, since they become harder and harder to
catch.

These passwords are for the Warrior Level, which I recommend since
the other levels do not let you advance to the last planet.

I dont remember the exact planet names, or the exact features that
the passwords give, but this should be good enough to get you
going.

7th Saga

Q: I found the Wind Rune in the Cave of Melename.  The problem is
one of the other apprentices stole it.  How can I get it back?

A: This is a very common problem.  If you have had the Wind Rune
stolen and have travelled past the town of Eygus, I usually
suggest that people reset the game.  The problem is that the
apprentices in the early sections of the game are very difficult
to beat.  Usually you have to get EXTREMELY lucky in order to
defeat them.  It would take you about 45 minutes to obtain the
Wind Rune from the start of the game.  It may take you in excess
of five-six hours to beat this apprentice.  If you remember to
save the game each time you enter a town, you will be able to
simply reset the game if you should lose your Rune.  This will
allow you to start from the last place saved.  So, you should be
able to prevent anyone from stealing your Runes.

Q: In the Cave of Melename, I see a doorway, but there are some
rocks blocking the entrance.  How do I move these?

A: Travel to the Town of Zellis.  Enter the inn and speak to the
villager inside.  His name is Brantu.  Brantu will join your
party as a third person and will open the rocks blocking the
doorway.  If Brantu will not join you, return to Bonro and get
the Map from Gain.

Q: How do I get the Water Rune from the Wizard of Guntz?

A: You must continue talking to the Wizard of Guntz until he
agrees to trade you the Water Rune for some water.  Next, travel
to the Village of Pell; in the tavern, you will find a villager
named Digger.  Once he has joined your party, travel back to
Guntz and Digger will bring water.  The Wizard will now give you
the Water Rune.

Q: I keep hearing about a secret entrance in the Town of Patrof. 
Where is this entrance and will it allow me to enter the Castle?

A: If you search each of the tombstones in Patrof, you will find
one that reads: "Do Not Disturb."  Stand beneath this tombstone
and push your control pad up.  The tombstone will move, revealing
a secret stairway.  Yes, this stairway will lead you into the
Castle.

Q: There is a rock in the Cave of Milto that I can't seem to
move.  How do I move this rock?

A: You must have three Runes to start this process.  Enter the
Town of Bone and look for a little Boy.  If you talk to the Boy,
he will ask you a question about Bonro.  If you answer "No," he
will either give you a Remote Control or ask you to take him to
Bonro.  The Remote Control will open the rock in the Cave of
Milto.  If you take to Boy to Bonro, his Uncle will arrange for
you to take a boat ride.  Both of these options accomplish
basically the same thing.  If you get one, you will not get the
other.

Q: I defeated the Dragon in the Village of Luze.  The game tells
me that the Rune has been stolen.  How can I find it?

A: Since there is no way of preventing the theft of this Rune,
you need to try and locate the apprentice who stole it.  Trying
returning to the Towns you have visited already via the Wind
Rune.  Once inside a Town, step outside.  Look in your Crystal
Ball located in the upper left corner of the screen.  If the
circle representing the town is flashing, the thief is in that
town.

Q: How can I enter the Tower of Grime?

A: If you have Olvan as your main character, travel to the Town
of Bone.  Once on Bone, walk to the bottom right corner.  Here
you will find an old man who will give you the Key of Brilliance. 
If you don't have Olvan, don't worry.  In the upper right corner
of the continent you will find the North Tower.  In this Tower
the is a Flashing Square.  If you step on this Square, you will
be teleported into the Tower of Grime.

Q: How can I find the Cave of Laosu?

A: From the Village of Padal, walk south until you reach the
mountains.  Now walk west along the mountains and you will enter
the Cave of Laosu.  The entrance is invisible!

Q: I defeated the Serpent Lady in the Castle of Baran.  Prosa,
the commander promised me the Moon Rune if I defeated her.  Now
when I talk to him, he asks me to find Pegim and will not give me
the Rune!  Why?

A: Return to the Village of Zellis.  In the tavern talk with
everyone and you will locate Pegim.  Now return to Prosa and he
will give you the Moon Rune.

Q: I can't seem to find a way through the Flames in Bilthem
Castle.

A: When you enter the Castle, immediately go left and walk up the
staircase.  Now walk south to the wall and go left.  Look for a
narrow hallway leading up.  Take this hallway to the top and go
left.  Take the staircase down.  Now you will enter the flames
from the right hand side.  You should find a narrow passage
through them.

Q: OK, so I made it through the flames and found Doros, but I
can't beat him because he splits into three.

A: Follow the direction above.  Except instead of entering the
flames, continue walking down until you find a staircase leading
down.  Here you will find a Wooden Table.  Push the Table and you
will find a Key.  To the left of this Table you will notice a
Jail Cell.  Open the Jail Cell and release the Old Man being held
prisoner.  He will give you an item called: Star.  Use this item
on Doros and you will be able to defeat him.

Q: I made it to Brush, and Brantu won't let me in the basement. 
What am I supposed to do?

A: First, you need to have six Runes.  If you are missing one or
more Runes, read through the above sections again and find which
one you missed.  If you have not missed any, it is likely that an
apprentice challenged you to a fight, defeated you and took your
Runes.  If this has happened to you, you need to travel from town
to town, looking for the apprentice.  Once you have six Runes,
return to Brush and speak with the Fortune Teller.  Now speak to
Brantu and he will fly you to the next continent.

Q: I am at the next continent and I lost my magic.  I have also
found Gorfun the main Boss but he disappears, what am I doing
wrong?

A: You need to locate the Moonlight.  The Moonlight is located in
a cave southwest of Guanta.  In this cave you will face Metal
Pison.  After defeating him you will locate the Moonlight in a
Treasure Chest.  Return to Guanta and someone will remove the
curse restoring your magic.  When you face Gorfun, use Moonlight
on him when he disappears.

Q: I have received the seven Runes again!  Where do I go now?

A: Walk to the upper right corner of the continent, here you will
find the Final Castle and Gorsia waits within!

Q: How do I fight the Apprentices?

A: Fighting other apprentices is difficult because they're always
built up to about the same level your character is, but you can gain
the advantage by memorizing their attack patterns.  They vary, but
each uses the same pattern when fighting the same opponent.  When you
first fight, survive as long as you can and write down their pattern
of attack so you'll know how to plan for your next bouts.  Enemy
apprentices might use healing spells as extra steps, but they'll
return to their regular patterns in the next rounds.

Q: Where do I fin the Apprentice who stole the Sky Rune?

A: Use the Wind Rune to warp from town to town, looking for the
apprentice thief who took the Sky Rune.  At each town, step outside
and look at the town in your crystal ball.  If it looks normal, warp
to a new town, but if it flashes, there is a Rune to be found in the
town.  Enter and save your game at the Inn, then search the tow for
the apprentice who took the Sky Rune.  You'll have to defeat him or
her to get the Rune.

Q:  How do I use the Runes against Gorsia?

A: When you reach Gorsia in the Castle of Gorfun, you must use the
seven Runes in a particular order before you attack.  Use them in the
following order: Wizard, Light, Water, Star, Moon, Wind and finally
Sky.  Using them in any other order will be ineffective.  Attack after
using the Runes.

SimCity

Bonus Gift Trick - Pick a land with plenty of water in it, but do not 
pick an island.  Make sure you pick a land with water near the 
middle.  
Now, create roads, find the middle of the land and make a cross 
with these roads all the way to the edge of the map of you land. Do 
not connect the cross in the middle of the water, or the trick will 
not work.  Once you make a cross with these roads near a body of 
water, you will be able to build anywhere from two to five casinos or 
amusement parks!

More Maps - Select "Start New City" on the menu screen, then choose 
any map number between 1 and 999.  "Ok" the map you want. Go into the 
map and choose the "Go to Menu" icon at the top of the screen. Do NOT 
save this.  Choose "Start New City" again on the menu screen.  Wait, 
and the same map that you chose earlier will turn out to be a 
different map with the same number!  This works all the way from map 
1 to 999, giving you a total for 1998 instead of the regular 999.

Sim City $999,999
How to raise your treasury to $999,999
Get into a situation where your cash is near zero and you 
cannot give 100% to the Transit, Police and Fire Departments, then do 
the following procedure only WHEN THE TAX SCREEN APPEARS AT THE END 
OF THE FISCAL YEAR!

1. Hold the LEFT and RIGHT Buttons on the top of the controller
DO NOT RELEASE EITHER BUTTON UNTIL THE PROCEDURE IS COMPLETE
2. Select "Go with these figures"
3. Exit back to the Building Screen
4. Select the Taxes Menu
5. Increase Transit, Police and Fire to 100%, bringing your cash
flow to a negative number
6. Select "Go with these figures"
7. Return to Building Screen
8. When you release the LEFT and RIGHT buttons the cash amount
will change to 999999

Bingo!  A million bucks to work with.  You can almost never use 
it all up.  But if you do run out of money just repeat the procedure.  
It works every time.

One word of advice.  Do not use the procedure until you have 
acquired the Bank.  The Commercial Zones which surround a Bank 
usually become C-Tops quickly, so having the Bank is worth the wait.  
The Bank is acquired when your have a population of 10000 people and 
less than $2000, if I recall properly.  What I do is play normally 
until I acquire the Bank, then build Police or Fire Stations until I 
run out of money.  Then wait for the fiscal year to end and do the 
procedure.

Please note that this procedure only seems to work at the end of 
the fiscal year and the tax screen must come up automatically or is 
does not work.

How do I defeat the metallic boss in the Painting?  (Area 1)
You must defeat him without having the Zantetsu (anti-metal) sword.  It
can be done -- it's just very time-consuming.  Lure him to the left, then
walk up the central ramp and hit him once as he approaches you (stay at the
top of the ramp, don't touch the platform he's confined to).  Then rush back
down the ramp and lure him over to the left again.  It's boring, but it
works.

Emblem A:  Use the ZANTETSU sword to kill all the metal creatures in the
Painting in Area 1.  You'll release some ivy that leads to an
area containing the Emblem.  (walk around)
Emblem B:  Once the soul of the man who "knows everything about Castle
Magridd" joins you, go back into the Torture Chamber section
of Area 6, and look around for invisible chests.  One of them
contains the Emblem.
Emblem C:  In Area 2, the right-hand squirrel in the right-hand tree
(the tree with the 'hungry' squirrel) will give you the Emblem.
Emblem D:  In Area 3, you will free a sleeping dolphin who appears in the
prison area (where Lue is being held captive).  Use the Dream
Rod on him, then equip the Great Pearl and talk to him while
you're in his dream.  Step on the monster lair he was standing
on in the dream.  Back in the real world, you should find a path
on the west side of the area just before the final boss.  The
path leads to an area with 4 chests, one of which contains the
Emblem.
Emblem E:  In Area 4, you will free a snail, into a room that doesn't
seem to have any entrances.  It has a hidden passage (it looks
like rock, but you can walk through it) leading into it.
From your blue transport square in the 'town', try to walk into
the wall to the southwest of you.  You'll find the path, if you
have freed the snail.  He'll give you the Emblem.
Emblem F:  You'll find a sleeping mushroom in Area 4 (inside the punishment
room).  Make note of where he's standing in his dream (use the
Dream Rod).  Then go back to that spot in the real world, and
you'll find the Emblem.  (It's in the action area just before
the Boss).
Emblem G:  In Area 5, on the first floor of Leo's house, there is a room
in the southwest corner containing a dresser, a plant, and a
cat.  Push the dresser to the west, the Emblem is underneath.
(I have no idea how you were supposed to realize this -- I called
Nintendo and asked them.)
Emblem H:  In Area 6, when you free the guard that causes the castle to be
rebuilt (along the northern edge of the town), the Emblem will
appear along the outer wall of the castle.  From your blue
transport square, just walk outside and go west.

Location of the three Red-Hot items for summoning the Phoenix
Red-Hot Ball  :  In Area 7 (the Evil World), it's inside a treasure chest.
 You can only reach the treasure chest via the transport
 squares -- when you've gone far enough to see the chest
 in question, the transport square will appear, and you'll
 be able to get to it from the temple screen.
Red-Hot Mirror:  When you go back to Area 2 with the SPIRIT Sword and kill
 all the floating yellow balls in the Light Temple, you'll
 free a bird, who will appear to the west of the restaurant.
 (You'll free more than one bird.)  When you talk to him,
 he'll give you the Mirror.
Red-Hot Stick :  When you go back to Area 3 with the ZANTETSU Sword and
 kill the metal gorillas on Dorean (the volcanic island),
 you'll free a Mermaid.  Go back and talk to her, and she'll
 give you the Stick.

The Ending for the game continues after the end of the credits.  Wait for
about 20 seconds, and it should continue.

You can get a lot of XPs in the World of Evil by going to the transporter
field that connects the next-to-last and last parts of it, equipping the
Soul Armor, Soul Blade, and Phoenix magic, and going back and forth between
the two sections, killing the three rotating metal walls on the last part,
then entering the red transporter square to return to the previous section,
re-entering it to return to the final section, and killing the metal walls
over again.  Repeat as desired -- they're worth 4000 xps each.

Semi-Invincibility Mode - only "semi", because you can still die by
falling off a cliff or into the flames at the bottom of the 2nd stage
of the 'Inside Sandcrawler' scene.  Also, it only works on the side-
scrolling screens.  Press and hold A,B,X,Y on the 2nd controller,
then press (but don't hold) SELECT on the 2nd controller.  You should
see some X/Y coordinates appear at your character's feet.  You'll
be "semi-invincible", and will be able to walk through walls, etc.
(Please verify whether this first requires entering the Level Select code.)

How to get 99 Lives - 
In the Land of the Sand People, there are 2 sets of floating rocks, in
which you have to jump from rock to rock, to get to the other cliff.
At the very beginning of the second set you come too, jump off the
cliff edge, and aim Luke to the left. You will land on a ledge, and
you will be in a small cave area. Falling rocks will keep falling on
you, but don't worry about that. Now shot up in the air all over the
place to reveal 1-UPs. There are 7 or 9 of them. Get them all and then
commit suicide. When the game starts up again, you start at the cliff
top again. Jump down and repeat til you have 99 lives.

Sound Test - Hold down X,Y,A,B and press SELECT and START at the same time.
It should bring up the Sound Test screen and give you some codes.  (Hopefully
all those codes are right here in this list, so you don't need them.)

Gain Extra Men

Well...  for those who want an extra advantage.  On the 2nd board,
after you find your Tauntaun.  Go to the cliff past the first
bigheart underneath?  Jump off the cliff and push to the left and
you should land on some invisible floors.  Then fall off the left
edge of the floor while slashing with your light saber and you
should be able to accumulate 4 free guys among other things.  Then,
you just kill yourself, giving you a net of 3 guys.  Just keep
repeating this up to I think 99 free guys? I dunno, I got to about
20 and that helped me the rest of the way.

Empire Strikes 1ups, gun ups
From: Michael Clark <mclark@grits.valdosta.peachnet.edu>

I found a secret room where there are numerous "treasures" in
Super Empire Strikes Back. In the Carbonite chamber (Han Solo),
at the first deep drop-off, if you climb down the left side
jumping on the protruding jets as you go down you will come to
a hidden room where there are grenades, 1ups and gun-ups. After
you leave the room you do not have to die to get back to the top.
Just climb up, the same way you went down, jumping from jet to jet.

StarFox

Fly through all the arches at the beginning of the first stage (any level
of difficulty), and a Twin Blaster will appear a short distance ahead of
you, under the last arch.

Whenever you see a roughly circular formation of rocks or other objects,
you can generally cause a powerup to appear by flying through the space in
the center of them.  It doesn't seem to matter if you accidentally destroy
some of the objects, so long as you fly through the area that was originally
surrounded by them.

THE WHALE -- Appears if you do not shoot any Blue Sting Rays.  It will
appear on the Amoeba level of Path 2, the one that ends in the spinning
boss with the long arms.  (The stage right before Venom.)  It appears just
before you reach the boss, and drops enough powerups that you reach the boss
with full energy, a shield, double twin blasters, and 5 nova bombs.

How to reach the Black Hole - About halfway through the Asteroid Belt (Lvl 1,
Area 2), you'll start running into 'strings' of 5 asteroids, where the
center one is orange (destroyable).  Fly towards the center rock of each
of these 'strings', and then destroy it just before you collide with it.
After three of these, watch very carefully for a gray asteroid that has a
strange 'face' on it.  It'll show up almost immediately, so keep a careful
eye on any normal-seeming asteroids that turn up.  Fly directly into this
asteroid. (You can shoot it first, if your shields can't take the collision.)
You'll get a brief visual effect, then be dropped back to the map screen.
Your ship will be repositioned at 'The Awesome Black Hole'.

How to reach Out Of This Dimension - 
Play on Path 3, the hardest one.  Finish the first area by defeating the
Ground Carrier.  In the second area (Asteroid Belt), fly along, doing the
usual things (destroying ships and rocks) until you see a large asteroid
approaching on the left or left-middle of the screen.  This is your cue to
start watching for another large asteroid that approaches on the *right*
of the screen.  When this one on the right shows up, start shooting it, as
fast as you can.  If you pump enough firepower into it, it'll break open just
before it passes you, and it will spit out an egg.  The egg will float off
into the distance (I usually try to shoot it, this may or may not be vital.),
and then will hatch into a bird.

The bird will slowly make its way towards you.  When it gets pretty close,
start trying to keep it in your cross-hairs.  (I do this from the Cockpit
view, but I don't know if it matters.)  Fly into it when it gets close --
try to hit it around its chest level.  I decelerated so I'd have a better
chance of catching it.

If it goes past you, crash into rocks to die, and try it again with your next
ship.  It takes less than a minute to reach the bird's location from the
start of the Asteroid Belt, so this isn't too annoying.

If you hit it correctly, the screen will go weird on you, and you'll be
dropped back to the Map Screen.  Your ship will be moved to a small
galaxy-shaped thing that wasn't visible before.

Congratulations.  You're now in "Out of this Dimension".

It's a fairly easy area, but there don't seem to be any powerups of any
kind.  Just pieces of 'paper' floating around that fold themselves into
paper airplanes and missiles and then come after you.  Destroy them for
a while, and you'll get the "incoming enemy" message and sound effect.

A giant jackpot machine will fly in.  It has no energy bar.  The only way
past it seems to be by getting "7 7 7" on its wheels.  Sometimes the buttons
under the windows will light after a spin.  Shooting the button will keep
the wheel above it from spinning on your next pull of the lever.  (You pull
the lever by shooting it.)  Unfortunately, I can't figure out what lights the
buttons, and you can't shoot them unless they're lit, so you can't save your
7's unless they're lit.  (There's also a demon-faced thing that can come
up when you spin -- if any of them come up, the jackpot machine flips over
and spits out lasers and missiles a couple of times.  A friend threw a Nova
Bomb at the machine while it was spinning, and it come up demon-demon-demon.
Coincidence?  Dunno.  But it shot at him a lot more than it normally does.)

Any spin that contains a cherry is a "win", and the machine flips over and
spits out orange and gray coins.  If you fly through them, they replenish
your shields.  I'm not sure if there's a difference between them.  These
"wins" prevent you from saving any of the current wheels.

If you get "7 7 7" (I got lucky and got it on a random spin), the machine
spits out a bunch of coins and then blows up.  You get the usual sound
effects from destroying a boss, and then some credits roll.  (This is the
normal credits sequence from winning the game.)  You can fly around
trying to dodge the credits, but it seems not to really do anything.
Later, the letters "THE END" will show up, in various colors and positions.
Shooting them makes them fly away and come back in a different orientation
and/or color.  If you get them all orange and right-side-up, they all fly
away and come back again.  There seems to be no real point to it.  It kept on
doing this til I got killed by the ships that fly around at the same time,
then gave me the normal death sequence and "game over".

Rumor has it there may be something secret here if you shoot the letters of
'Game Over' in the proper sequence.

U.N. Squadron

Extra Difficulty Setting -- Plug in the 2nd controller.  Go to 
the option screen with the 1st controller and highlight the 
difficulty setting. Hold down the A and X buttons on the 2nd 
controller, and then change the difficulty with the 1st 
controller.  You should see a new level called "GAMER".

Methods for defeating:

Use the F8E until you can afford an Efreet
First board - Tank
No weapons.  Shoot at the tank treads and dodge the rockets.

First Air board -- Big Stealth
Hit the big Stealth with three clusters as soon you can see 
it. Be sure the grab the (3)power-up after the first 
cluster. You have to be at least half way up the screen to 
get it. Next, hit the Stealth with bombs until it rises too 
high then launch your megacrusher. Get behind the Stealth 
and fire away, staying between the air charges and away 
from the center of the Stealth

Sub
No weapons.
Stay in the upper left part of the screen when you are not 
shooting the Sub.  (I think it's worth buying the bombs 
just to get the board over with more quickly.)

Land carrier
(Two of the small caves in the early part of the level 
contain powerup items... one that opens to the left 
contains a Smart Bomb item, and one that opens to the right 
contains a $5K star.) You don't need weapons.  Take bombs 
though. Get low on the deck.  You can shoot out the 
aircraft launchers and the rocket ports, but you have to 
change elevation a little and dodge around.  You don't have 
to raise up until the end. You will be below the big rocket 
fire. Once you have disabled everything except the big 
rocket launcher, raise up to just above the mountain line 
and fire at the top edge of the big rocket launcher.  He'll 
die fairly soon.

Second Air board -- Small Stealths
Bombs and megacrusher.
Use bombs to take the guys behind you.  Get above them. You 
have to keep up or you're dead.  Use the megacrusher on the 
three Stealths.  They are weak now. Shoot-em-down.

Minks battleship:
This guy is hard.  Take all the weapons. (There's a $5K 
star between his stacks, and a weapon powerup on the far 
right end of the ship.) Fire at the small gun on the front.  
Raise up to the top of the screen before you get too close 
or the Unicorn will pass.  Be sure to get the Unicorn.  Try 
to hit the stacks until you get to the middle of the ship 
and then launch you megacrusher. It will knock out all the 
small arms in the central part of the ship.  Drop bombs on 
the rear big guns. Get get below the deck for the turn 
around.  Raise and knock out he back small guns.  If you 
have enough fire power you can target the the two big guns 
and still stay away from their fire.  You have to get just 
high enough.  Once the big guns are gone, fire into the 
stacks (he'll flash when you hit the right spot). He'll 
die. You don't have to knock out the front guns.

Forest Fortress:
Take all your weapons, just in case...
There is a Unicorn just before the fortress, immediately 
after the ground-based missile launching grids, but I can't 
figure out exactly where it is. Get to the level where you 
can hit the front cannon and the aircraft launcher at the 
same time. You can stay here and clear out the whole front 
of the fortress. Don't move until you knock out the last 
cannon. Raise up and hit the big cannon low.  Use you 
cluster bomb or regular bomb to take out the last aircraft.  
The cannon will blow up if you hit it hard. Next, hit the 
rocket launcher. Drop a few bombs on it at the same time 
you shoot at the second large cannon.  Get the fuel-up at 
the end.  Take out the rear small cannons the same way you 
did the front cannons. Go back to the rocket launcher and 
take'em out. (When you turn around for a second pass, 
there's an Energy powerup at almost the same height as the 
small turrets.  Shoot the end one from the right, and it 
should appear.)

SR71 Blackbird:
(One of the rock towers contains a $5K star.)
Take all the weapons.
Use napalm to get the rocket launchers.
Use the gunpod once the air battle starts.  Get below the 
Blackbird with the gunpod and go to work.  That's all it 
takes.

Cave Fortress:
(There's a Smart Bomb item in the area with all the ledges 
and planes, shortly after the first vertical ascent.) This 
one is pretty hard.  I've only beat it once so far. Take 
cluster, phoenix, gunpod and megacrusher. Shoot down 
everything until the second ground machine gun then use 
phoenix, until you get to the vertical ascent.  Before 
entering the column launch a megacrusher.  Get up and over 
to the upper middle cavern, launch a second megacrusher. 
Use cluster until the vertical descent where you go back to  
phoenix.  Use all your phoenix up.  Too many weapons get in 
the way at the end.  There is a Unicorn at the upper right 
when you get to the one-eyed-machine.  Get the Unicorn, 
keep the conveyer belt clear with your gun and clusters.  
Shoot the crap out of the eye (up close) with the gunpod.  
The eye turns red and he dies.


>From :tagreen@lothario.cica.indiana.edu:
Here's some advice on the final level.
I use phoenix, gunpod, megacrush, and cluster.  Use the 
phoenix in the early part until you shoot the red cannon in the 
narrow tunnel, make sure you are on cluster at that point in 
time to use it to take out the blue planes that come from 
behind. Switch back to phoenix. Rocks will come up from the 
ground.  You can blast them with your normal gun.  Use the 
phoenix to take out any planes that come around and the missiles 
that drop from the ceiling.  Next two tanks and more planes and 
helicopters come, you can take them out with the phoenix or 
clusters (or normal guns).  After this you fly through anarrow 
winding corridor and there is a weapons recharge, get it! and 
use your phoenix to take out more of the dropping missiles.  
Keep your phoenix and use them to take out the guns that move on 
a grid, there will be a weapons recharge/damage recharge item in 
the lower right section of this area.  Next you go into another 
narrow corridor and there is a unicorn in the cut away section 
on the top.  After this you come to a "mini ship"  I just blow 
him up with my normal gun dodging the missile that he shoots.  
Next is the mother ship. First blow up the nose-cone and then 
take out the top cannons with your guns and all 3 megacrushes 
(assuming you got the weapon recharge token)  This should have 
blown open the middle of the ship showing you the inner 
mechanics and also have blown up the top tail fin.  You'll now 
be past the ship and will want to switch to the gunpod.  You'll 
pass under the ship, take out the bottom tail fin with your 
normal gun, and then take out the first underside cannon with 
your gunpod, next blow open the underside of the ship with the 
gunpod, you'll now turn around and pass over the ship again, try 
to shoot the front of the ship to take out as many pistons as 
possible, as you pass overhead use the cluster to blow up the 
remaining top pistons and the main piston.  Finally you'll pass 
underneath again and use the gunpod to finish her off.  If you 
do it right, you won't even lose the shield that you got from 
the unicorn.

a ledge in the light world that can't otherwise be reached

How do I get all four Magic Bottles?

1) Buy one from the Bottle Salesman in the Light World village, for 100
Rupees.
2) In the Light World village, the building south of the one with the sick
boy in it has a rear entrance.  There's a chest inside, with a Magic
Bottle in it.
3) If you swim upriver from Lake Hylia in the Light World, you'll swim under
a bridge.  There's a man camped out there, and if you talk to him, he'll
give you a Magic Bottle.
4) After completing the Ice Palace dungeon (the one with the 5th crystal, in
the Dark World), a locked chest will appear in the Dark World equivalent
of the Blacksmiths' House.  Get the chest, return to the Light World via
the Magic Mirror, and go talk to the 'middle-aged man' just outside of
the Desert.  He'll open the chest for you if you agree to his
conditions.  You'll find a Magic Bottle inside.

How do I make money in this game?

After you've gotten the Power Gloves that allow you to lift white rocks, go
to the southwest portion of the Light World.  Just outside the desert, you'll
find an alcove with two large white rocks in it.  One of them has a staircase
under it, and leads to a room with 10 vases in it.  Each vase has 5 Rupees.
Loot them all, and then walk back outside.  You can keep entering, looting,
and leaving until you have however many Rupees you'd like (up to 999).

How do I catch the man that runs away from me in the Light World village?

Approach him from the west.  As soon as he starts running away from you,
Dash Attack (via the Pegasus Shoes) towards him.  You'll catch him.  All
he does is tell you to try dashing into Trees, anyway.

How do I open the locked chest I found in the Dark World?

Take it to the 'middle-aged man' at the entrance to the Desert in the Light
World.  Agree with whatever he asks you.

What should I do with the Magic Powder?

Once you've gotten the Magic Hammer, go jump into the hole outside the
Blacksmiths' House in the Light World.  Sprinkle Magic Powder on the altar
you'll find down there, and you'll gain the ability to perform magic at
half the normal magic point cost.

You can also sprinkle it on the white-and-red flying skulls that drain your
Hearts and Magic gauge in the dungeons, and they'll turn into Faeries.  Quite
an improvement.  (A rare few of them are immune to this.)

There's also a chicken in one of the houses that will turn into a woman if
you sprinkle Magic Powder on her.  Doesn't accomplish anything, but it's
amusing.

What things trigger Crystal Switches?

1) Hitting it with your Sword.
2) Hitting it with your Boomerang.
3) Hitting it with the Hookshot.
4) Having a Bomb go off near it.
5) Hitting it with an Arrow.
6) Hitting it with the Fire Rod.
7) Hitting it with the Ice Rod.
8) Throwing an object (vase, etc) at it.
9) Hitting it with the beam of energy fired by any Sword of Level 2 or
higher, while you're fully healed.
X) Probably some other things I've forgotten.

How do I kill the green and red guys who follow my movement?

Fire an Arrow near one, and make him walk into it.

Where are the eight Transport Squares in the Light World?

1) In the far Southwest corner of the Desert, under a black rock.  Only
reachable via the Flute.
2) In the Northwest part of the grassy area in the Southern part of the
world, under a white rock.  You need the Magic Hammer to reach it.
3) At one of the lowest points on Turtle Rock.
4) On the top of Death Mountain.
5) On top of Turtle Rock, but you must first use the Magic Hammer to hammer
down the posts you find there.  Hammer them in a Counterclockwise
direction, starting with the Southeastern one.
6) In the easternmost Southern entrance to the Lost Woods.  If you go there
from the South, you'll need the Titan Gloves to lift a black rock.  If you
go there from the North (inside the Lost Woods), you'll need the Magic
Hammer.  The transporter is under a white rock.
7) Under the black rock on the largest island in Lake Hylia.
8) In the center of a circle of posts (need Magic Hammer) near a cave mouth
in the eastern quadrant of the world.  Hard to describe, sorry.  It's
under a white rock.
X) The entrance to Hyrule castle, after you've defeated Agahnim for the
first time.  Just walk through the front gates, and you'll appear in the
Dark World...it's not strictly a Transport Square.

How do I get into the dungeons?

Castle Hyrule, the first time:
There's a bush on the eastern side of the castle, covering a hole.
Lift the bush and jump in.

First Light World dungeon (1st pendant):
Just walk in.

Desert Palace (2nd pendant):
Read the Book of Mudora in front of the green stone in the center
of the desert.

Tower of Hera (3rd pendant):
Just walk in.  However, you'll have to enter the Transporter atop
Death Mountain, and then use the Magic Mirror to return to the Light
World on top of Spectacle Rock in order to *reach* the dungeon.

Castle Hyrule, the second time:
Remember the energy barrier you saw blocking one of the outside doors
the first time around?  Hit it with the Master Sword.

Palace of Darkness (1st crystal):
Pay the monkey to follow you, and then pay him to open the door.

2nd Dark World dungeon (2nd crystal):
Use the Magic Mirror to return to the Light World.  Enter the building
there that corresponds to the dungeon entrance.  Push the blocks out of
your way, and exit north.  Pull the right-hand lever, then go back
outside and return to the Dark World via the Mirror's transport square.

Lost Woods (3rd crystal):
There are a number of mouths and holes around, and all of them lead
into some area of the dungeon.  Try them all.  There's also one that
is buried under a bush in the center of a 3x3 patch of bushes.

Thieves' Den (4th crystal):
Pull on the tines of the pitchfork held by the demon statue in the
center of town.

Ice Palace (5th crystal):
Enter the transport square under the black rock on the island in the
center of Lake Hylia (Light World).

Swamp of Evil (6th crystal):
In the Light World, use the Flute to go to location #6.  Lift the black
rock to your right, and enter the transport square there.  Then go
north, and look for a platform with the 'Ether' symbol in the center
of it.  Stand there, and cast Ether.

Turtle Rock (7th crystal):
Go to the equivalent of Turtle Rock in the Light World.  Hammer down
the posts you'll find there.  Start with the Southeast one, and work
counterclockwise.  Enter the transport square that appears.  Stand on
the 'Quake' symbol just south of you, and cast Quake.

Ganon's Tower:
Just walk up to it, and the 7 crystals will break the seal on the door.

How do I get into the last part of the Lost Woods dungeon (3rd crystal)?

Stand in front of the big insect-like thing, facing north.  Use the Fire Rod
on it, and you'll burn open an entrance.

I'm at the end of level 3F in Ganon's Tower (the final Dark World dungeon,
after Turtle Rock), and I can see a ledge along the south wall, but I can't
seem to reach it.

See those blocks across from the ledge?  Dash into them from the south, by
either standing right on the edge of the platform, or by facing east, holding
the button down to Dash, and then facing North just before the Dash causes
you to move.

for half the distance, turn left for half the distance, turn left for
half the distance, turn right (now you should be in front of the path)
