| I have never used an actual Super MagiComm before, and I would strongly    |
| recommend not using these unless you know what each one does for sure. If  |
| you're going to write an OS for the SNES, i'll be at your door worshiping  |
| you when it comes out.                                                     |
|                                                                            |
| The below registers i've never tested, or had tested. If you end up de-    |
| stroying your MagiComm because of this, I TAKE NO RESPONSIBILITY IN WHAT   |
| YOU DID. Someone could remap the $C007 Disk Control Register to the +5v    |
| pin on the SNES, and you could end up with a room full of smoke (I doubt   |
| it, but it'd be funny: I'm not an Electrical Engineering guy)...           |
|                                                                            |
