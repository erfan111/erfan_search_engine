Notes:
------
- For testing purposes, Black Widow boards can be plugged directly into a
  Gravitar harness.  If you want to actually play the game, you'll have to
  add 4 extra wires at P20:[8/9/K/L] for the extra control panel inputs.
- The "CABINET" pin (P20:R) is potentially interesting.  I haven't played
  with it, but suspect that if you tied it to GND (or left it open), you
  could play the game on a cocktail cabinet.
