
        The following is a list of "Game Doctors" and its capabilities I
compiled for your information.  And what is "Game Doctor", and it's
origin. 

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
	"Game Doctor" is the name giving to devices that can read the ROM
on the video game cartridges and store it on floppy disk, which later can
be play back on the video game consoles without the original cartridge.
	The first "Game Doctor" got its start on the Nintendo Famicom
(Japan's NES).  As most of you know, Famicom has a 2.8" disk drive
available for it, and to save the material cost, many software maker
publish games on the 2.8" floppy.  (I think Nintendo choose to use a 
nonstardard disk size to control software piracy, as there won't be much
blank 2.8" floppy disks around to copy the games on.)  Anyway, sooner or
later, someone has written a disk copying program(don't think it's ever
legal in Japan).  And somehow as the years go by, there's plenty of blank
2.8" disks around.  I guess that's why there's never a disk drive for the
U.S. Nintendo, and now, most of the new games in Japan were out in cartridge
only.  To counter this, somebody made some new hardware that connects to the 
Famicom and the disk drive that backs up the games on to the floppy.
Thus, creating the first "Game Doctor".
	Applying the same concept to other video game consoles, many 
companies in Hong Kong and Taiwan made such devices for Famicom, and then
for PC-Engine, Genesis, etc.  These were the first generation "Game Doctors",
which only works with one type of machine, and generally uses the old 2.8"
Nintendo disk drive.  (Don't think there's ever any "Game Doctor" made
by a Japanese company, as the software companies, Nintendo, and Sega would
suit the pants off that company.  And Hong Kong had historically ignored the 
copyright laws of other countries.  They even have Nintendo Famicom clones.
Don't know about Taiwan. )
	As there are many limitations to the first generation of "Game Doctors",
like, limited storage of 2.8" floppy disks, only one megabit per disk, 
too expansive for multisystem owners, having to buy a "Game Doctor" for each
of his video game system, etc., comes the second generation of "Game Doctors".
	Almost every second generation of "Game Doctors" have a 3.5" drive,
and many of them can be use with serval different types of game systems at
the same time.
	And right now, the third generation of "Game Doctors" have already
been out.  The latest "Game Doctor" uses the more expansive static RAM,
to prevent hung up in the middle of the game.  (as DRAM has to refresh 
itself every cycle, and ROM do not, these could cause problems with the
video game consoles.  Static RAM acts much more like ROM than DRAM.)
Also, the new ones can be use with any video game systems that's ever out
and will be out in the future, including portables, like Game Boy, and 
Game Gear.  As all they have to do is to make a new interface.  And the 
size of the third generation "Game Doctors" is about a bit larger than a 
VHS video cassette, and can be use on battery power.
	I would not discuss how the first and second generation "Game Doctor"
works, instead, I'll talk more about the third generation, which I think
should be the most interesting to you.
	Currently there are two "Game Doctors" that are of the third generation.
They are 'Multi Game Doctor 2' and 'Super Twin Star', both made in Hong Kong.
The main unit contains a 3.5" HD disk drive, a LCD display, and a 
microprocessor for controlling, with a slot on the side.  They are about
the size of a VHS video cassette, can be use on battery power or AC.
To play a game from the disk, you first insert a special RAM cart into 
the slot on the main unit.  Then you load the game data onto the cart.
After that, you take out the cart, and plug it into an interfacing cartridge
for your type of video game console.  Then turn on the game console and play!
Isn't that simple?  As to how do you get the games on disk, first you
get the game cartridge you want to play.  Then, plug it into a special
interface for that type of game system, and plug the whole thing into the
slot on the main unit, and select the function BACKUP on the main unit.
And it will back up the cartridge on to disk.
	And as these two "Game Doctor" uses the standard IBM disk format,
you can pop the disk into your PC and modify the game, using PC Tools or
other disk editing program.  Like making the game to give you unlimited
1-ups or invincible, etc.  The possibility are endless.  And as to which
bytes to change, they're frequently published in Hong Kong video game
magazines.

Where to get the "Game Doctor"?
--------------------------------

	Of course if you can go to Hong Kong, you can get it there.  But, if 
you are like most people, which you won't be in Hong Kong in the near future,
and don't have any friends there,  you could try to find some specialty
Hong Kong importing company and ask them to get one for you, which they
many times charges no less than 50% of the price of the system.
