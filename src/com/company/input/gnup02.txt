Alien 3 (tm) Game
Help Ripley really rip into those nasty aliens with these power 
codes. RIP Codes 37 and 38 sometimes enable Ripley to jump through 
walls and ceilings. Be careful, though, because she can stuck in 
ceilings or walls or get trapped forever if there's no room on the 
other side. If this happens, reset.

Dragon's Fury (tm) Game
This is a challenging video pinball game where you have to destroy 
monsters and creatures to try to advance to the mystery stage. The 
hidden passages to the bonus stages are fun, but it's tough to get the 
points you need to reach the mystery stage (NOT!--FURY Code 26 lets 
you start with a bonus multiplier of 9 instead of one). With Codes 13 
thru 26, the bonus multiplier will reset to 1 and bonus points will 
reset to 100 after the first bonus (except if you also use Codes 27 
and 28). Note that Codes 1 thru 26 may be affected by use of 
passwords. And remember that in a 2-player game the players share 
the bonus; if it is not collected by one player, the current bonus 
values are available for the other player to collect.

Evander Holyfield's Real Deal Boxing (tm) Game
This exciting and realistic challenge is named for the ex-champ, but 
it still provides up-to-date fun and action. With DEAL Codes 1 and 7 
you must win by a KO or TKO. Code 7 prevents boxers from being 
refreshed between rounds, since Round 1 never ends. Code 8 allows 
you to make a super boxer. You can give him Power, Stamina, Speed, 
and Defense at any levels you wish, but if you set all of them to 
their maximum values, then they can't be reduced.

Joe Montana II Sports Talk Football (tm) Game (Alternate Codes)
This is one of the toughest football challenges of them all, and the 
play-by-play is a cool feature. Plenty of Game Genie (tm) codes give 
you pinpoint control over plays, the clock, the length of the quarters, 
even the scoring values. Note that JOE2 Codes 11 thru 18 replace the 
20-minute game option on the options screen. The options screen 
will still display a 20-minute game, even when a code has been used 
to change this. The 40-minute game and 60-minute game options 
work as normal. Think you have Super Bowl potential? Try JOE2 Code 
1 and see if you can put together a scoring drive!
NOTE: THERE ARE TWO VERSIONS OF THIS GAME. IF THE "A" CODES DO 
NOT WORK ON YOUR GAME, THEN TRY THE "B" CODES

John Madden Football '93 (tm) Game
The fast-talkin' coach with the great games is back for '93. MAD93 
Codes 6 thru 12 can only be used with the 5-minute quarter option. 
The 10- and 15-minute quarter options operate as usual. With Codes 
25 thru 30, if the computer is allowed more than 4 downs, it still 
punts on the 4th down--so the advantage is yours. If the computer is 
allowed less than 4 downs, it will always run plays and never punt.

King's Bounty (tm) Game
Of the whopping 168 KING codes, 2 thru 156 are good only when 
starting a new game. Be careful when using Codes 159 thru 162 
without Code 163. In the early stages of a game, it doesn't take 
many troops for an army to get too large for you to control. When 
using Code 164, you will still see the number of available troops 
decrease as you recruit them. However, if you leave the troop 
dwelling and re-enter it later, you will see that the original number 
of troops in the dwelling has been restored. With Code 167, the 
number of days left goes down and time passes normally. When days 
left becomes 0, though, the game is not over. The counter will roll 
over to 65,535 and the game never ends. After a game where you 
used codes, if the game won't accept your password try Code 168. 
However, if you had too many of something (for example 5,000 days 
left), the game may reduce the number for you.

Pit-Fighter (tm) Game
This version of the popular arcade game features kicking, punching, 
and a nice variety of other antisocial behavior. As Ty, Kato or Buzz, 
you must fight for the right to face the Masked Warrior. Get to him 
faster with PIT Codes 1 thru 14. (The numbers of matches in these 
codes include grudge matches. In the 2-player mode, an extra 
elimination match takes place just before the championship match.) 
In the 2-player mode, Code 15 allows both players to team against

Sonic the Hedgehog 2 (tm) Game
Sonic's back! How do you follow one of the all-time favorite action games? Try 
putting a "Tail" on Sonic--and having it follow him! The 2-player competitive mode 
is excellent too. We have plenty of great SON2 Codes for you, including the 
much-requested jump codes. Enjoy! Codes 1 THRU 16 also work for Tails in a 
one-player game. There is only one total for Sonic's rings in a one-player game. 
Normally, you have to grab all seven chaos emeralds, get at least 50 rings, and 
jump to turn into Super Sonic (and be invincible). But by choosing from among 
Codes 58 thru 64 and 65 thru 69, you can reduce the number of emeralds and 
rings you have to get. With Code 70, you won't lose your rings with time and drop 
back down to regular Sonic. And to help you become Super Sonic on the last 
level, where there are normally no rings, Codes 58, 65 and 72 will do the trick--
just jump. Finally, access the level select menu with Code 71.
THERE ARE 2 VERSIONS OF THIS GAME. IF ONE CODE DOESN'T WORK 
ON YOUR GAME, TRY THE OTHER

OK, sports fans. Line up to play with the Olympic dream team in a 
realistic game of hoops against their world-class opponents.

you can break the rules. Get a head start against the tough computer 
or a human opponent with DREAM Code 6, and stop the shot clock 
with Code 12. If you're an expert, give your opponent a 25-point spot 
and play the game without any timeouts with Codes 11 and 21.
