|     As early as the first crop of Street Fighter II clones hit the
| arcades, people have dreamed of pitting their favorites from one
| game with the top contenders of another.  To a limited degree this
| has happened with Ryo Sakazaki in Fatal Fury Special (and somewhat
| with Geese Howard in Art of Fighting 2).  But in the Summer of 1994
| comes the first real effort, "The King of Fighters '94".
|     SNK has pooled together the stars of the Art of Fighting and
| Fatal Fury series, introduced several new characters, and in a
| surprising twist, invited personalities from two previous games,
| Psycho Soldier and Ikari Warriors in a super 24 character battle.
| Prepare for the KING OF FIGHTERS '94.

|                                  |__/
|Team Play
|~~~~~~~~~  KOF94 uses a Team-Play system, more or less an extension
| of the usual one-on-one system of previous fighters.  Players select
| their team to use, and the order in which they wish to use them.
| When a character wins a round, their strength meter is recharged
| slightly, and they continue to the next round versus the opponent's
| succeeding character.  A total 5 rounds are thus possible. (6 if you
| tie.)
|     For "traditional" fighters, there is the option for one-on-one,
| best two of three matches.  In arcade units, this is an operator
| option (meaning it's either or, but not both for the player.)  Home
| users may select either mode.  You may pick the character to carry
| you through the game, but you will only fight one person per team,
| getting you to Rugal in 8 matches.
|
|Sidestep
|~~~~~~~~  Pressing A and B simultaneously will cause your character
| to lean to the side momentairly.  During this time you are
| invulnerable to attacks.  Useful for dodging fireballs (rather than
| taking block-damage) or dodging a body-attack then following up with
| a throw or other move.
|
|Assist Attack
|~~~~~~~~~~~~~  If you've been dizzied, simultaneously press the A, B
| and C buttons and one of your teammates will jump in and strike
| your opponent, buying you some time to recover.  This will also
| release you from submission-hold type moves.  Two conditions however
| are that you be in front of your team,  (also works in the "middle"
| of the screen) and that at least one of them was not defeated in a
| previous match.
|
|Defensive Attack
|~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~  Borrowed from the Fatal Fury Series.  If your
| opponent comes at you attacking, block the attack, push the joystick
| forward and press A or B.  You'll do a strike which will strike your
| opponent through their attack, sometimes even through a fireball if
| done near.
|
|Power Meter
|~~~~~~~~~~~  The POWer meter is a hybrid of the Spirit meter in the
| Art of Fighting series and "Rage gague" in Samurai Shodown.  The
| greater it is charged, more damage is done by your moves, it may
| also be "teased" down (see below.)  When charged to Maximum, your
| character will flash, and an additional "super" move may be done
| (see below for more details.)  The meter may be charged in two ways,
| by holding down the A, B and C buttons simultaneously, or by
| blocking attacks.
|
|Supermoves
|~~~~~~~~~~  First introduced in Art of Fighting and also applied to
| Fatal Fury 2 (and FFSpecial) the super/desperation move system has
| undergone an additional change.  As usual, you may do it when your
| strength is low (signalled by your strength bar flashing).  Now, you
| may perform your super move at any time during the round if your
| POWer gague is charged to "Maximum", your character will flash at
| this time.  These moves are marked by a "MAX" in the move list and
| the last move listed for each character in the quick sheet.
|
|Tease
|~~~~~  Position yourself across the screen, center the joystick and
| press the C (strong punch) button tease your oppoent.  Any charge
| below "Maximum" on your opponent's Power Meter will be reduced.
| Tease animations may be interrupted.
|
|Ties
|~~~~  In the event of a tie or double KO, both fighters for that
| round are eliminated.  If a tie happens in round 5, then an extra
| round is held with the third characters at full strength.  If a tie
| still occurs, the game ends for both players.

|Origins
|~~~~~~~  KOF94 brings together characters from SNK's last two
| fighters, Art of Fighting 2 and Fatal Fury Special.  Two of SNK's
| older, pre-NeoGeo games, Psycho Soldier and Ikari Warriors are also
| represented in this title.  The World Heroes do not appear in this
| game as popularly believed as the WH series is by ADK, not SNK.
| Samurai Shodown, an SNK game, does not appear either, most likely as
| it's time setting is too far off.
|     The "returning" characters are as follows:
| Fatal Fury Special:
| - Terry Bogard, Andy Bogard, Joe Higashi:  fighting for Italy.
| - Kim Kaphwan:  fighting for Korea, he's found two rather unusual
|                 characters for his team.
| - Mai Shiranui:  fighting under England's flag with the two women
|                  of Art of Fighting 2.
| Art of Fighting 2:
| - Ryo & Takuma Sakazaki, Robert Garcia:  fighting for Mexico.
| - Yuri Sakazaki, King: fighting for England with Mai.
| Ikari Warriors:
| - Clark, Ralf:  fighting from Brazil with their leader.
| Psycho Soldier:
| - Athena, Kensou:  fighting for China with their drunken-fist
|                    master.  Athena actually originates further back
|                    further with a game by her name.
| Other Appearances:
| - Italy:  From the Fatal Fury series, Cheng Shinzan, Big Bear, Tung
|   Fu Rue, Duck King, and Jubei Yamada appear.
| - Mexico:  Sitting at his own private table (at the right of the
|   stage) is Geese Howard, behind him stands Richard Meyer, owner
|   of the PaoPao Cafe.  Also behind the table stands Eiji Kisaragi,
|   Above him Todo Ryuhaku and Mr. Big wave their sticks.  On the
|   left side of the stage stands Lee PaiLong with his back to the
|   action, to his right stands Micky Rogers & Temjin.  And from
|   Top Hunter, next to Todo stands Roddy and Cathy.
|     Characters for Team USA and Japan are all new.  (No relation
| between Kusanagi Kyo and Mutation Nation.)
|
|Rugal <barnshutain> (sp)
|~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ ...is the sponsor of the King of Fighters
| tournament this year, (note the "R" flags in England) _and_ the
| final "boss" who fights _alone_.  The fight takes place in his
| (aircraft) carrier Blacknoah. The first round, he uses no special
| attacks (be warned that he still does heavy damage this way.)
| Second round, he begins fighting "at full strength", you can look
| forward to these heavy attacks:
|  ReppuuKen        Like that of Geese Howard
|  Kaiser Wave      Like that of Wolfgang Krauser.
|  Genocide Cutter  Spiraling Kick
|  God Press        Rushes and slams opponent into opposite wall.
|  Dark Barrier     Like Athena's Psycho Barrier.
|  chest grab       Lift and strength drain.

|Software
|~~~~~~~~  Released in it's various formats (JAMMA late August?, MVS
| early September, Home early to mid October) the game soft size is
| 196 Megabits.  And for Western home units, it's CENSORED!  To keep
| the kids who carry $200 in pocket change from turning into crack
| sucking homicidal rapists who tear tags off of mattresses, and to
| appease paranoid overcautious parental groups, KOF'94 has been
| censored.  "Blood" and certain extraneous bodily motions have been
| removed when the game is run on an American console.  It's still in
| there however and can be brought out via installation of arcade
| ROMs into your NeoGeo console (be warned, that this will void any
| warranty.)   OR, through a code ("Blood Code" or "Bouncy Code",
| depends how you view it. =^)
|    When the high score screen appears simultaneously press AD on
| controller 1 and BC on controller 2, no signal will sound.  Start
| the game and all will be restored.  The censor will reset when the
| game ends.

|~~~  This FAQ is available via FTP from ftp.netcom.com in the
| /pub/vi/vidgames/faqs directory, or from kaiwan.kaiwan.com in
| /user/dvillnva/neogeo_faqs.  Filenames to look for (following the

|
|Note on Translation
|~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~  To appease those non-Japanese speakers playing
| the game, I've written English translations to the Japanese names.
| Some were borrowed from SNK givens (i.e. Andy: Kuhadan --> Sonic
| Split) the rest are my own work (Kyo: OboroGuruma --> Twilight Ride)
| Be warned however, that not all are _literal_ translations.  Many
| only use a part of the original name as I've tried to write English
| names to capture the "feel" of the Japanese name (translating the
| _entire_ name word for word sometimes makes for a rather silly
| result).  There is a difference in "definition" and "emotion".
|     Use the [bracketed] translations if you wish, but I highly
| encourage you to use the Japanese original.
