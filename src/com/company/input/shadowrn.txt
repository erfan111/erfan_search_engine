I.	Introduction

Welcome to the unofficial Shadowrun walkthrough. This information is intended
to guide people who either are stuck in Shadowrun, or who have rented it for
two days and need to get through it lickety-split.

< WARNING > This file is essentially an ordered list of spoilers. I take no
responsibility for ruining your fun.

All of the appropriate stuff is copyright to the appropriate people.  This
walkthrough was compiled and is maintained by Greg James -
james@skyler.arc.ab.ca. Any comments or corrections are welcome.

This FAQ is also available by FTP, courtesy of GamePro magazine's Andy
Eddy. Just FTP to ftp.netcom.com and cd /pub/vi/vidgames/faqs.

A quick note about me - I don't actually own the Shadowrun cartridge...in fact,
I don't even own a SNES. So, if you have a correction, make absolutely sure
it's correct, because in order to verify it, I'll have to go swipe my
girlfriend's brother's SNES and then go rent Shadowrun from the local video
store. If it then turns out that you're wrong, I won't be pleased.



II.	Definitions

Because making an ASCII map is a huge pain in the ass, this walkthrough assumes
that you know where all of the buildings are.

First, we have a list of regions and associated sub-regions. These are all the
places that I talk about in the walkthrough. If you don't know what is where,
it's up to you to find out.

Anything encased in square brackets [] is optional. Usually it means extra
story context, though it is not necessary to progress in the script.

B. Oh, so this is the rest of the city. I guess I should get some spells.

1. R2 caryards
Talk to people
Learn caryards, matrix, Drake, King

2. R2 arena
The lineup of opponents is: Gang Member, Heavy Dude, Heavy Dude, Mage, Mage,
Street Samurai, Ferocious Orc, Gang Leader, Troll Decker, (Replicating) Mage.
IMHO, the Gang Leader is the most difficult, since he moves around a lot, and
you lose your tracking.

There are two paths to take here. One involves getting negotiation and buying
your way out, and the other involves killing the King.

	Variation 1 (Recommended)
	-----------
	Win all the arena fights up to and including Ferocious Orc
	Save game
	Challenge King
	If you lose, go get more stamina

You will win 3000Y for killing the King, plus save yourself the Y2000 you would
have paid him to get out. This should allow you to buy mesh armour and a
shotgun almost right away. You cannot fight the King once you've paid him off.

	Variation 2
	-----------
	Talk to arena owner
	Ask about negotiation
	Pay him 1000Y for negotiation skill 1
	Once you have negotiation 3 pay King 2000Y to get out
	
Purchasing negotiation is worthwhile at any rate.

D. Drake Towers

By this point you should have all the spells except armour. Also you should
have dermal armour, mesh jacket, ruger pistol, and heightened reflexes. If you
don't, things are going to be pretty tough.

On each floor, step off, and immediately cast invisibility. Shoot everyone, and
grab their money. Run your action glove over the scene to locate all the
computers. You will find locks on the elevator, data files giving you more
story line, and nuyen.

At one point you will find Drake's phone number. Calling him is interesting,
though not necessary.

1. First floor
1 computer - elevator lock

2. Second floor
2 computers - elevator lock, data file + 8000Y

3. Third floor
3 computers - data file, elevator lock, trash data only

4. Fourth floor
2 computers - data file, elevator lock

5. Fifth floor
2 computers - level 6 node + elevator lock, 2 data files + 10000Y

6. Sixth Floor
1 computer - elevator lock

7. Roof
Destroy sentry guns
Talk to helicopter pilot
Ask about volcano


E. Volcano

The volcano is, in my opinion, the most difficult part of the whole adventure.
My guess is that by now you should also have an assault rifle.

The computers here contain a lot of money, and you have to crack all of them to
find out what they have. It is worth taking notes to remember which ones are
useful, and which ones aren't. There are also special routes to take that avoid
most of the troll decker sentries.

One thing you might find useful is a notation for getting through the computers
in case you die and have to do it again. I use a notation where I note how many
ICs I ran into in a certain computer. It is totally dependent on the route you
take, so my notes won't help you much. For example, one of the computers is
notated 1-2-2-1L/1-1L-2. The numbers indicate numbers of ICs, L indicates that
the last square is an IC, and the / means lots of movement.

1. Sub-level 0
Nowhere to go but down

2. Sub-level 1
2 computers of note - program, elevator lock

3. Sub-level 2
1 computer of note - elevator lock

4. Sub-level 3
5 computers of note - data file + Y, data file, Y, data file + Y, 
	elevator lock

5. Sub-level 4 - max security
Run left instead of going through the doors
Kill 3 nagas
Enter room at the end
Exit
Kill naga
[The last three steps can be repeated many times for bags o' karma]
Get serpent scale

6. Leave volcano
Go back up
Ask helicopter pilot about Drake

7. R3 docks - Dog warehouse
Learn Armour spell
Get it up to level 6

8. R3 volcano
Go down to sub-level 4

9. Catwalks
Use invisibility to avoid damage
Kill troll deckers
Kill scientists

10. Drake room
Cast armour immediately (deflects falling freezes)
Get in range of Drake
Use Jester Spirit (It blows bubbles. Drake is immobilized during this, though
	you are not.)
Use armour or freeze to avoid getting killed
Use shooting or powerball to kill Drake

11. Computer room
Talk to scientist
Ask about head computer
Get Aneki password
	(Assault Cannon and Full Bodysuit available at Dark Blade gun shop)


F. Aneki Building
By the time you're here you should have (at least) the assault rifle, and
partial bodysuit+dermal armour. As you enter each area, cast invisibility on
any allies you have, then just slug it out with the baddies.

1. First floor
1 computer - elevator lock

2. Second floor
2 computers - datafile + level 3 node, elevator lock

3. Third floor
2 computers - 10000Y + 12500Y + data file, elevator lock

4. Fourth floor
2 computers - 25000Y, elevator lock

5. Fifth floor
2 computers - 50000Y + 20000Y + 15000Y, AI computer

You're finished! Stick it out through the credits - there's more stuff
afterwards. They don't make much sense, though.



IV.	Greg's Comments

Weapons
-------
Try to upgrade your weapons as little as possible, because you lose money every
time. Try for Beretta, Ruger/Shotgun, Assault Rifle, Assault Cannon. IMHO, the
Uzi sucks, but the shotgun's nice.

Armour
------
Try for Leather Jacket, Mesh Jacket, Dermal Armour, Partial, then Full.

Computer
--------
You will need level 6.

Negotiation (obtained from arena owner)
-----------
For all the hype you get at the beginning of the game, negotiation is pretty
lame. Hiring is cheaper with negotiation skill but I think hiring is
over-rated, too.

Leadership (skillsoft purchased from street doc 2)
----------
Much more money-conscious than negotiation. If you have level 6, Norbert will
help you kill all the Rust Stilettos, kill all the rats and the Rat Shaman, and
clear out the main floor of the Dark Blade HQ on one contract. If you're slick,
you can even get him to escort you through the Dark Blade crypts.

If you hire Kitsune, Leadership is irrelevant.

Heal
----
Requires three items from Dog's followers: one of the Earth, one of a creature,
and one of a man. (enchanted leaves, magic fetish, and dog collar) Heal is
good, because it represents the most bang for your magic buck. That is, you can
do way more damage by shooting and using heal lots than you can by casting
powerballs. Get level 6.

Powerball
---------
Requires two items that have not rested in the Earth. (Paperweight & ghoul
bone) I don't find it that useful. When making this file, I didn't use
powerball at all. One person has reported that it works well against Drake.

Summon Spirit
-------------
Requires two items of Dog's pack (Dog tags & Dog collar) I don't find this
useful either. Kitsune's summon spirit is nice when facing Vladimir's ghouls.

Freeze
------
Requires the residue of two sea creatures. (octopus ink and mermaid scales) I
never found freeze that useful. This is because SR tends to throw a lot of
enemies at you, in which case invisibility or armour is more useful. It works
well on Drake.

Invisibility
------------
Requires water from a clean and unclean source. (Water fountain and Toxic
Water) Indispensable.

Armour
------
Requires the scales of a warm and cold blooded creature. (Naga & mermaid
scales) I'm not sold on armour - invisibility works better against everything
except Drake, and Freeze works better there.

Firearms
--------
About 11-13 should do you. It help extend the usefulness of your weapon, which
may be becoming underpowered.

Stamina
----
About 12-14. It should be this high to make the best use of your heal 6 spell.

Magic
-----
The more the merrier. You'll need at least 12.

Hiring
------
With the exception of hiring Norbert as soon as you get to region 3, I found
hiring unnecessary. As soon as you get any good, their principal role is
drawing fire while you run through the screen. This is especially true in the
Dark Blade crypts and the volcano. Hirelings taken to the Jester Spirit or to
Drake will either die or suck off so many magic points you will die.

If you take Kitsune with you to the Rat Shaman, she will stick with you for the
rest of the adventure. Keeping her alive is challenging, since she can only
wear a leather jacket, and she only has 50 HP.

Karma
-----
In region 1, use the office next to your apartment or the graveyard
In region 2, use the caryards dead end

In region 3, use the docks, the Bremerton deck, Vladimir's crypts, or wait for
the gold naga in the volcano. With the naga, kill it once, then run into the
room at the end.  Exit the room, and kill it again. Yo! 6 karma! Repeat. Don't
pick up the serpent scale until you're finished.

Money
-----
Kill people in the zones designed for getting karma and loot their bodies.
	Ghouls have no money.
The computers in Glutman's office, Matrix Systems, the Dark Blade club, Drake
	Tower, the volcano, and Aneki towers have money accounts.
Compete in the arena
Kill the Rat Shaman, the octopus, or Vladimir
Once you have finished the Bremerton, every time you go through the Jester's
	dimensional portal, Vladimir re-appears. Kill him again for another
	Y5000.
Sell your old stuff

        These are some basic ones, there are ones for increasing life but if
        your stamina goes over 250 the game freezes. Also if you have 250 the
        game freezes (slows down to impossibility in the Matrix only).
