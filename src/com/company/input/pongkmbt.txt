OTHER THINGS

------------------
TO ACCESS DIP MODE
------------------ 

Type 'pongkomb DIP' to start the game.  If you have a frame-rate change 
already stacked on the parameter line, use 'pongkomb speed x DIP'.
Alter the switches with up and down on the keypad.  Left and right selects
a switch, and space leaves the screen.  Switch flips aren't saved after
you quit Pong Kombat.
   
DIP SWITCHES and what they do.
 
1-comic advert on/off    (default : off)
  Turns on and off the ad for FWLS Komiks and short stories.  I installed
  the feature back when it looked like Komik would be out before Pong
  Kombat.  No release date is set due to a NASTY bug.
 
2-fatality check on/off  (default : on)
  Turns the blood on or off, except for Purple's weapon, which is drawn-in.
  I had to install this to qualify Pong Kombat as a school project.
  Kids, violence is evil.  Bad!  Bad!  Stomp out violence!  Kill all
  violent people!  Maim!  Dest... umm.  But I digress.
 
3-taunts on/off          (default : on)
  Shut Monolith up by clicking this to OFF.  He can be annoying.
 
4-extra credits on/off   (default : off)
  Flipping this on adds some more scanned photos of the staff that worked
  on the game to the end of the credits.  Credits are shown after White
  Paddle's demise.
 
5-white first on/off      (default : off)
  Turning this switch on will fast-forward the tournament mode right to
  white paddle.  I used this to test the ending sequence.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------
PONG KOMBAT SECRETS 
SECRET CHARACTERS
 
There are two major secret characters in the game, Monolith, and Shifter.
Shifter gives no clues like Monolith does.

-----------------
TO FIGHT MONOLITH
----------------- 

He speaks of a few clues, but here's the whole story... every now and then
on a missed ball, Nick Steele pops out and goes 'WHOOPSIE!'.  If he does
this on the Portal stage, press DOWN and your BUTTON.  You must press
these AFTER!!!! the speech clip finishes... there is a split second timing
type thing.  There will be an evil laugh, and Nick will vanish.  At the
end of the match, win or lose, the last person to down+button to Nick
gets to fight Monolith.  There is a one in ten chance of Nick showing
on a lost ball.
 
Monolith almost never misses a shot, and has large, fast-moving stars
as weapons.  He is relatively hard to kill.
 
----------------
TO FIGHT SHIFTER
---------------- 

On the Throne Room stage, execute a SPAMALITY.  Spamalities are the
sequence BUTTON, BUTTON, BUTTON, UP after the announcer yells 'FINISH
HIM!'.  There will not be a siren, but the screen will clear and
your opponent is turned into two slabs of luncheon meat.  Notice that
the tablecloth is the same pattern as the toilet bowl water.
 
(NOTE : Spamalities REQUIRE a flawless victory, or else nothing will
 happen.)
 
Shifter blends into his background and NEVER misses a shot.  His weapons
are extremely hard to see, fly quite fast, and quite often.  He is
insanely hard to kill, but if you're good enough to get a spamality,
you're probably close enough...
