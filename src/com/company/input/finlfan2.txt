	Characters(player controlled):

		Cecil:
		   Occupation: Dark Knight --> Paladin
			The main character in the story, and ultimately
			the stringest member of your party. He can use
			almost any weapon, but works well with a sword.He
			can be equiped with almost any armor, and can cast
			a few low level white magic spells after he becomes
			a paladin.
		Kain:
		   Occupation: Dragoon
			Kain is mostly here for a plot twist. He is Cecil's
			best friend, and begins the game by your side. He
			can be equipped with any sword or spear(except crystal)
			and can use almost any armor.
		Rydia:
		   Occupation: Wh. Wiz./Bl. Wiz./Caller -->Bl. Wiz/Caller
			Rydia is a caller from the town of mist. She falls
			unconscious after Mist is destroyed by the package.
			Cecil protects her and she joins him in battle. At
			first, she can cast both black, white, and caller magic
			but after she visits Leviatan, she can use oonly black
			and caller magic, which have been dramatically increased
			She can use only a bow and arrow, the rod, or a whip.
			As for armor, Rydia can only use robes.
		Rosa:
		   Occupation: Wh. Wiz.
			Rosa is Cecil's girlfriend from Baron. Cecil finds her
			in Kaipo after an earthquake, and must find the Sandruby
			to help her. After that, she joins Cecil's party. She is
			a user of white magic, and, like Rydia, can use Bows and
			arrows(and should). She can also use the various staffs.
			For defense, Rosa relies on robes, and no shield.
		Tellah:
		   Occupation: Sage(Wh. Wiz./Bl.Wiz)
			Tellah is a sage from Mysidia, who joins you on the way
			to Damcyan. At first, he can only use low level black 
			and white magic, but after Mt. Ordeals, he becomes very
			powerful, although his mp remains low. He can use the 
			staff or rod in battle, and can defend himself with
			weak armors and robes.
		Edward:	
		   Occupation: Bard
			Edward is the Prince of Damcyan. After losing his 
			girlfriend in an attack by the Red Wings, Edward
			chooses to help Cecil. He attacks by using one of the
			two harps, and defends with low level armor or robes.
		Cid:
		   Occupation: Engineer			
			Cid's special talent is PEEP.He can tell you how many
			hit points a monster has and what its weaknesses are.
			He can use a bow and arrows, but he works better when
			using a wrench.He can use most armors. 
		Edge:
		   Occupation: Ninja
			Edge is the prince of Elban, which was destroyed 
			recently. You find him in the Elban cave, where he
			gets beaten by Rubicant. He can use the very powerful
			ninja swords and some armors. He can also cast strong
			magic spells. As an added bonus, he can throw almost
			every item as a weapon and steal items from enemies.
			This makes him the most versatile character in the game.
		Yang:
		   Occupation: Karate Man
			You find Yang on the way to Fabul. After assisting him,
			he joins you. He can attack using the claws, and he can
			use some armors. His special move attacks all enemies on
			the screen. It is good when fighting low level monsters,
			but for stronger monsters just have him attack normally.
		Fu Soya:
		   Occupation: Lunar(Bl. Wiz./Wh. Wiz)
			He is a very powerful wizard from the moon. He will join
			you as soon as you find him in the crystal palace. He
			can use some armor and the staffs/rods, but his real
			strength is that he can cast just about all black AND
			white magic spells.
		Porom:
		   Occupation: Bl.Wiz.
			One of the twins of Mysidia, Porom can cast low level
			Black magic. When paired with his sister, they can cast
			the twin spell, which should be the strongest magic
			you have at the time.Equip him with a rod.
		Palom:
		   Occupation: Wh.Wiz.
			The other twin from Mysidia. She can cast low level
			white magic. She should be equipped with a staff.

The story so far.....

	You are Cecil, the dark knight, and Captain of the Red Wings,
the powerful air force of the city of Baron. Cecil has just taken a crystal
from the people of Mysidia. Upon returning the crystal to the King of Baron,
Cecil wonders why he was ordered to do such an act and asks the King his 
intentions. Accused of disloyalty by the King, Cecil is removed from his 
post as Captain of the Red Wings and is made to bring a package to the small
town of Mist, in the Northwest. His friend, Kain, a Dragoon, comes to Cecil's
aid, but, he too is ordered to go to Mist. As the two begin their new mission,
your adventure begins...

********************************************************************************
Questions.........and answers

How do I defeat...

	Octomamm:Use Rydia's call magic(chocobo) and Tellah's lit spell
		along with Cecil's powerful attacks to defeat him. Not
		very difficult to beat.

	Antlion:Since the antlion responds to hand attacks by taking off
		alot of damage, use magic and Rydia's chocobo to win here.
		Have Cecil attack (if you think you can spare the hp's)
		but you really only need him here to administer cure potions.

	Milon(1):Have Cecil attack Milon directly, as he cannot harm the
		undead monsters. Let Tellah use his fire spells and make
		the twins cast TWIN until the battle is over. If you need
		to refill energy, use Tellah or potions, as MP are hard to 
		come by this early in the game. Immediately after defeating
		Milon, save your game at the nearby save spot.

	Milon(2):Right before the end of the bridge, use change to reverse
		the rows of your party This will save you tim during the fight
		and let you get an extra attack in. Milon will use poison
		against you, so have Tellah use heal potions or the heal staff,
		if you have one. Have the twins TWIN, and make Cecil attack.

	Baigan:The middle section of Baigan will cast WALL on itself immediately
		after the battle begins, so if you use magic, use it on the 
		arms. Have Cecil attack the body and have Yang use his
		special attack.

	Kainazzo:Immediately have your wizards(Tellah/Palom) cast their 
		strongest Lit spells. Use Porom to heal your party after
		Kainazzo floods you. Have Cecil and Yang attack as normal.

	Dark Elf:When you first fight the Dark Elf, you must intentionally lose
		the fight. If you have ALOT of hp, attack yourself, or else it
		will take forever. After he beats you, Edward will use the
		Twin harp to revive you. You will have full hp and mp, but it 
		wouldnt hurt here to save the game in the room right outside.
		Just attack the Dk Elf as any other enemy; his only attack
		is a combo of ice, lit and fir(all level 2), which isn't
		even that strong. When you defeat him you will be rewarded
		with the Crystal of Earth. 

	Magus Sisters:The main strategy here is to attack the heaviest
		one first(middle). She is in charge of the wall spell. Do
		not use magic unless the sister casts wall a second time
		and it reflects onto one of your characters. If this happens,
		have Tellah cast his strongest spell (ONLY ONCE) on the 
		member of your party with the wall. You have a one in three
		chance of hitting the middle sister. Once she is defeated,
		the Delta attack cannot work and you should lose no more
		hp, making it easy to defeat the other two sisters.

	Valvalis:Have Kain constantly using his jump attack to stop
		her spin. have Cecil attack, and have Cid attack also. Use
		Rosa to heal you, unless you brought an extra set of bow
		and arrows along. Another good idea here is to carry some
		armor Rosa can use with you into the Tower of Zoot, and Equip
		her with it before you fight Valvalis. otherwise she is not well
		protected.

	Calbrena:Two strategies here: First, you can go all out and try to kill
		all six dolls before they merge. This is a great idea if you are
		powerful enough. Otherwise, you can just wait it out and heal
		yourself until they form CalBrena. After that, just attack as
		you would any other foe.

	Balnab/Dr. Lugae:Once you defeat these two, Lugae transforms himself
		and you must defeat him again. He's not that tough. Just use 
		your head and heal when you have to.
		
	EvilWall:Have Rydia use Virus(or Leviaa, if you have it already).At
		any rate, just make her do her most powerful magic. Edge should
		use the stars that you have picked up along the way so far. When
		those are gone, Bersk him. Rosa should Bersk Cecil right away,
		so he can get in more attacks. Have Kain jump every time. If
		one of your characters gets crushed, bring him back to life, but
		only use life1. Dont waste your mp filling him/her back up. Do
		that after the battle, because once the Wall starts crushing,
		it doesn't matter how many hp's you have, because you're dead.
	
	The King and Queen of Elban: The inportant thing here is to keep people
		alive. If you can last until the King and Queen come to their
		senses, you are all set. Have everyone use their most powerful
		attacks and heal as often as needed. Dont be afraid to use up 
		you MPs, because Rubicant heals you completely before you fight
		him. A good idea here is to go back down to the save room, just
		in case you think you cant defeat Rubicant.

	Rubicant:Its very difficult to time, but most of the time it works well.
		Have Rydia cast her Shiva or Ice3 spell, but try to time it so 
		she casts it as Rubicant opens his cape. Otherwise, Ice and cold
		spells heal him. Bersk Cecil(you should do this with every boss)
		If more than one of your characters are swoon, then have Edge 
		cast Flame. Rubicant will revive all dead members of your party.
		Have Rosa attack, then cure, then attack, etc.

	Queen Asura:Rosa must be at level 34 or everyone else must be at level
		99. Have Rosa cast the wall spell on Asura, and all her cures
		will reflect onto your players. She rarely attacks, so you dont
		have to even worry about curing yourself. Just attack her until
		she dies. She can't refill her energy.

	King Leviatan:Just attack him, and Cure yourself after he waves you. As
		always, besrk Cecil and this time Edge, as well.

	King Bahamut:As soon as you get FuSoYa, go to Bhamut's cave on the moon.
		You can do it without him, but it is MUCH MORE DIFFICULT. Use 
		Rosa and FusSoYa to cast wall onas many members of your party 
		as youcan before Megaflare comes. Use your judgement here...
		decide for yourself which charcters you need to stay alive. If
		you can get them all, great. But chances are, your wizards 
		aren't at a high enough level to cast wall spells quickly. A 
		good alternative (if you have a game genie) is to buy potions
		(any kind) and use the codes above to alter them. One of the
		items they can be is a wall potion. This makes casting it easier
		as every character can do it at the same time.

	CPU:This is a snap if you got the bahamut spell before returning to 
		Earth. Attack the healing globe first, then the attacker, then
		concentrate on the big one. You are likely to fall victim to
		GLOBE99, which instantly kills your character. Just have Rydia
		do BAHAMUT constantly, and have FuSoYa cast his strongest spell.

	Zeromus:First, use the crystal(CECIL MUST USE IT). Once he has 
		transformed, Bersk Cecil. Have Rydia use Bahamut or Nuke.Have
		Rosa attack with White, unless you need to be cured. Zeromus
		will use Virus, Meteo, Big Bang, and the Black Hole. Big Bang
		takes off a coulpe thousand hps and then drains them for a while
		The Black Hole makes all magics invalid. This means that if you 
		casted a wall spell, it disappears. (I think that is the correct
		effect. It does nothing to deter any attack or heal magics. If 
		anyone can verify this, E-mail me. Thanx) Zeromus has 
		approximately 110,000 hit points. 
	
How do I get the Pan?
	Once you have gone through the Sylvan cave and found yang sleeping,
	go to the overworld and talk to Yang's wife. She will give you the Pan.
	Then return to Yang and use it on him. Then you will recieve the call
	magic Sylph. If you return to see Yang's wife after that, she will give
	you the spoon dagger, which can only be thrown by Edge. There is only
	one in the game, so save it for Zeromus. It takes 9999 damage.

How do I reach the four treasure chests below the town of Summoned Monsters?
	To reach the chests, go to the first floor of the town. In the lower
	right area there isa hidden spot you must walk on. It looks like a 
	normal peice of the floor, except it is outlined in brown. Step there
	and you will go to the room with the four chests. A note of caution:
	If you want to stay in the town after opening the chests, walk back to 
	the tile you came in on. The other tile in the room warps you back 
	outside.

Where is the Pink Tail?
	On the moon, go to the Lunar Subteraen, Level 5. Walk all the way to 
	the right, and there is a room with a chest on the right side. It is
	the only thing in the room, and there is a cabin inside the chest.
	Walk around the room for a while, and eventually you should bump into
	a Pink Puff. Defeat it and it may give you a Tail. BTW, the chances of
	finding a pink puff are 1 in 64, and the chances of him giving you a 
	tail are also 1 in 64. You do the math. If you've got the time to kill,
	by all means, try it.

Tips from Adam and Kelly:
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

	-Don't "drain" undead monsters.

	-Dont use the lillith rod on a lillith.
	
	-If you know that you will "lose" a character(he will leave your party)
	then de-EQUIP him before he leaves so that you may keep the weapons and
	armor.

	-Immediately upon entering the Sylvan or Summoned monster caves, cast
	the float spell on all your characters. All characters can be effected
	at the same time-you dont have to cast the spell five times.
		
	-Its probably common knowledge, but were you aware that on the Big 
	Whale, if you walk down, you can see another room, two in fact. In
	the first of these two room, there are a bucnh of rectangle shapes.If
	you step on one of these, it refills all your life and mp. In the second
	room, there is a big Chocobo to store all your items.
