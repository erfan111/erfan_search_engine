          ======================January 1, 1995===================

Changes from 10/12/94 distribution:
  No game-play related changes.
  Added my new WWW site, http://www.csun.edu/~hbcsc003/will.html

This FAQ is based on a move list that was first posted by Alex Grienti
<at840@freenet.carleton.ca> about a week before the release of the MK][
home games in late 1994.  Since then it has undergone major revisions.
This document contains all the moves, babalities, fatalities, friendships,
and other known goodies for the Sega Genesis version of MK][. Recognition
goes to all who responded to my numerous queries, and especially to Alex
for producing this list in its earlier form.

The latest version of this document can always be obtained by FTP from Andy
Eddy's famous FTP site, at ftp.netcom.com, as pub/vi/vidgames/faqs/mk2gen.txt.
Thanks Andy!  For several months I was maintaining a mailing list of people to
receive updates to the FAQ, but I believe all secrets have been found, so I am
for now discontinuing the list.  Feel free to e-mail me at wirace@csun.edu if
you have any questions, though. Also check out ineluki@u.washington.edu's
excellent MK][ arcade FAQ; it has information that is directly useful to the
home versions.

I now have a World Wide Web Home page, which contains links to all my favorite
Web stuff, and I have also placed there some of my favorite MKII fanfiction as
well as the latest version of this document and my Genesis Aladdin FAQ. Check
it out, and send me your comments! It's at
http://www.csun.edu/~hbcsc003/will.html .

Unanswered questions:  1) Can anyone confirm that it is possible to disable
throws in a two player game? 2) Are there any mistakes or unclear passages
in this document? 3) Have you found something cool that isn't in here? If
you have answers to any of these questions, please get in touch at
wirace@csun.edu!

Please distribute far and wide, but a) Do not distribute modified versions,
and b) do not charge for distribution, except for nominal connect-time
charges.

Enjoy!

   Term         Meaning
   --------------------------------------------------------
   THAT(THIS)   Press THIS while holding THAT.
   THIS(n sec)  Hold THIS for n seconds.
   n THIS       Press THIS n times.
   THIS+THAT    Press THIS and THAT together.

   THAT (n)     After doing THAT, you should be n character
                widths away from your victim for the move to
                work.
   1/4 F,THAT   Rotate the D-pad from down to forward, then do
                THAT.  Reverse the motion for 1/4 B,THAT.
   1/2 B,THAT   Rotate the D-pad from forward through down to
                back, then do THAT.  Reverse the motion for
                1/2 F,THAT.
   360 B        Continuously rotate the D-pad counterclockwise
                if on the victim's left, vice versa if on right.

Examples:
 LK(2 F,D,F) (0):   Hold low kick, press forward, forward,
 down, forward, and release low kick, making sure that when low
 kick is released you're right next to the victim. (Kitana's
 kiss o' death)

 A(30 sec):   Certain fatalities involve holding a button down
 for quite awhile, and in this case longer than the time allowed
 to do the fatality.  You can charge these moves during the
 match, i.e., hold A when the match begins and don't leggo
 until "FINISH HIM!" appears to do the Kintaro fatality.


-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=MISCELLANEOUS NOTES=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-


RANDOM SELECT: Highlight the character in the top corner on your side (Liu
Kang for player one, Reptile for player two) and press Start while holding up.

BABALITIES/FRIENDSHIPS: These moves can only be done if you didn't use
either punch button during the wining round.

DEAD POOL FATALITY: After winning the second round in the Dead Pool, when
the "Finish Him" message appears, press and hold the Low Punch and Low
Kick buttons (B and C on three-button), move in close, then D(HP) while
still holding the other two buttons.

SLIPPERY SPIKES: Immediately after executing the PIT/SPIKES fatality in
Kombat Tomb, hold down on the D-pad to make the victim slip and fall off
the spikes.

SPECIAL CHARACTERS:
Noob Saibot: Win 25 matches in a row to play against the black ninja.
Jade: Win ANY round just before the "?" stage using only the LK button to
play against Jade.
Smoke: On the portal stage, press down and start the instant you hear
"toasty!" to play against Smoke.  In a two player match, the first person
to do this gets to fight smoke, and the other automatically loses.

PONG: Pong does not exist in Genesis MKII. Please send corrections only
if you have PERSONALLY seen it.

BACKGROUND ORDER:  The order for the backgrounds is Dead Pool-> Kombat
Tomb-> Wasteland-> The Tower-> Living Forest-> Armory-> Pit II-> Portal->
Khan's Arena-> Repeat.

TEST MODE! In the options screen, move the cursor to "Done" but don't
select it.  Enter LDL, RDR, LLRR on the D-pad.  This activates the test
mode, and turns Dan "Toasty!" Forden into a wierd cartoon guy. Also see
"FERGALITY!" below.

USING BLOCK TO STABILIZE: In the move list which follows, many finishing
moves involve holding the BL button while you do something else.  This is
only necessary to stabilize your character (i.e., so you don't jump when
you press U). If you can manage to do these moves without the BL button,
more power to you. In addition, you can use the block button during a
finishing move to prevent an accidental strike.  For example, in Kitana's
kiss o' death you must ordinarily press LK outside kick range, then move
in to do the moves. Instead, try pressing BL, then LK while holding BL,
then release BL, then do the moves, then release LK. This technique can
save you time, and can be also be applied to Jax's head pop, the acid
bath, and many other finishing moves.

FERGALITY! Turn on "oooh, nasty" in test pages.  Be Rayden on the Armory
(stage 6). Do 3 BA,BL (any distance) as your finishing move to do the
Fergality. The preceeding is a 100% confirmed method for doing a
Fergality, but may not be the only method.  Do you have one you'd like to
share with the rest of us?
