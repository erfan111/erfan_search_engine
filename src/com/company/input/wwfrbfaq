All righty, somebody, the other day, asked for a faq on WWF Royal Rumble
for the Super NES.  So I decided to write one.  There might be a revision 
depending on whether or not there is a need for one.  And also look for 
the WWF Raw faq sometime around mid January when I come back from vacation.

I.  The Different Types of Matches
   a.One on One
    *1.One fall(Till you pin your oppenent or opp. is counted out).
    *2.Brawl(Till your oppenent's energy bar is depleted).
     3.Tournament(Face 11 guys, in a row, advance by pinfall or countout)
   b.Tag Team Action
    *1.One fall(Same as above).
    *2.Brawl(Same as above).
     3.Tournament(Face 5 teams in a row, advance by pinfall or countout).
   c.Six man Action
    *1.One Fall(Same as above).
    *2.Brawl(Same as above).
   d.Royal Rumble
     explanation:Starts out with two men in the ring.  Then at regular 
     intervals other wrestlers join in til there is six men in the ring
     at once.  They can only be eliminated by throwing the wrestler over 
     the top rop.  Then other men join in when one is eliminated and at
     the end when 11 wrestlers have been eliminated, there is one guy 
     left standing:The Royal Rumble Champion.
*-Oppenents may be hand picked or done randomly.(Tournaments are only random)

IV Wrestler Profiles and Special Maneuver Execution.
(These are my descriptions and are not opinion of anybody except myself :-) )

1. Randy "Macho Man" Savage
WWF Former World Champion, Former Intercontinental Champion...now can be seen
in the WCW searching for Hulk Hogan(will find him during Starcade).
A great tatictian and great airalist.

Execute Flying Elbow Smash(Note: All special moves can only be done when 
there is only red left in the opponent's energy bar).
Go up to the turnbuckle and climb it, and then press R to execute it, the 
range is that quarter of the turnbuckle that you climb, right or left.  You
know when you do it correctly when Savage raises his arms and jumps down 
with elbow poised(does look different from regular elbow drop).

2.Mr Perfect/Curt Henning
Former Intercontinental Champion, now missing in action as far as I know.
Great technical skills and ring prescense.

Execute Perfect Plex
In the grapple, press the R repeatedly to get the plex, it will look like 
a pin suplex but he won't actually pin him(darn!).

3.The Undertaker
After beating Yokozuna at Survivor Series in a coffin match, he is now riding 
on his own wave of glory.  Soon to enter a feud with IRS...his seeming 
immortality and strength of moves will propel him to the top.

To execute the Tombstone(probably the most punishing maneuver).
In the grapple, press the R repeatdly to get the Tombstone, which will look
like a piledriver as he drives the victim to the mat.

4.Bret "Hit Man" Hart
After losing the WWF World Championship Belt to Bob Backlund in Survivor 
Series, is licking his wounds and will return to the WWF in early January
of '95.  Another great skills artist, so good, his fans call him the
"Excellence of Execution"...also Former Intercontinental Champ and Tag
Team Champ.

To preform his Sharpshooter
When oppenent is down and your back is not close to the ropes go in front of
his feet and press R.  This will preform the move, and after a while he will
let go as well.  

5.Crush
Little has happened to this guy.  After turning face and having feuds with
Lex Luger and Randy Savage, he fell out of the WWF and is now missing in 
action as well.  He has lots of strength.

Execute Craninum Crush.
When opponent is panting(done by atomic drop, choke, or certain numbers of
kicks and punches), go behind the wrestler and press R to execute the 
grab the hold of the head and press down toward the mat hold.

6.Tatanka
Recently turning face on Lex Luger and fans is now in Ted Dibiase's stable,
fighting to get rid of Luger. Speed and Strength are Tatanka's main 
attributes

Execute Fall-Away Slam
Fling your opponent toward the ropes and when he is coming back toward you,
press the R button and he will take the wrestler and put him on his 
shoulders and throw him back.

7.Ric Flair
After losing to Hulk Hogan in WCW in a career vs career match, he is now 
at home resting and enjoying the benefits of retirement.  He is a great
tatician and has the most stamina I have ever seen in a wrestler.  Flair 
is perhaps also the greatest of all time.

Execute the Figure Four Leglock
When opponent is down go over to his feet and press the R button.  He will
pick a leg up and slap on the move...he will eventually let go(another darn), 
and then it is up to you to go for the pin.

8.Shawn Michaels
He's just my sexy boy, sexy boy, not your boy toy, boy toy, oh sorry, 
defintely my favorite wreslter in the game if not in WWF right now. He is
a former intercontinental champion as well as a former tag team champion.
But in Survivor Series, the feud between him and former best friend Disel
(Incidentally Diesel is now WWF World Champion)erupted.  Now they are on a
collision course and I hope Shawn beats the crap out of Disel...Shawn has 
a lot of speed and some great tatics inside the squared circle.

Execute Back Suplex
Get the opponent stunned via atomic drop, choke, certain kicks/punches and
then go behind him and push the R button and Shawn will suplex him 
backwards.

9.Narcissist/Lex Luger
This powerhouse got beat pretty bad by the Million Dollar Team in Survivor 
Series.  But the feud against Ted Dibiase's stable has probably just begun.
The steel plate in his arm still causes controversy but his hordes of fans
still love this "made in the usa" character.

Excute Running Shoulder Butt
Defintenly the hardest move to master, throw your guy into the ropes, then 
start to bounce off the opposite ropes.  Then right when he is near you push
R and you should see your opponent on the ground with you flexing your 
muscles(Or else you two, would be on the ground from the collision :-( )

10.Yokozuna
After getting the coffin closed on him in Survivor Series, the giant diaper
boy will be seeking employment elsewhere, probably WCW.  He has defintely 
weight on his side as well as strength.  A sheer elbow from him could mean
it's over for yer wrestler :-(

Execute the Bonzai Drop
You execute this maneuver with the same range as you used with the "Macho 
Man"...but with a little difference...instead of climbing up the turnbuckle,
get to right where the turnbuckle is but push R instead of climbing it.  
Yokozuna should start to go through his motions and then go up to the 
second turnbuckle and pounce down on his opponent.

11."Million Dollar Man" Ted Dibiase
Now manages his stable which currently exists of Tatanka, King Kong Bundy,
Bam Bam Bigelow, Nikolai Volkoff(is he still wrestling under Dibiase?), and 
I.R.S. They have been doing very well, and right now, they can only destroy
themselves as I see it.  But I am not sure if Dibiase will ever wrestle 
again, I hope he does.

Execute the Million Dollar Dream
Get your guy stunned via choke, atomic drop, or right number of punches and
/or kicks.  Then get behind him and push the R button.  He will wear down 
and then just let go, with the guy still standing there and panting, just 
knock him over to go and pin him. 

12."Razor" Ramon
I got your machismo right here...the current Intercontinetal Champion.  
Always seen with his trademark toothpick, this fan favorite always seems 
to come through in the end.  He was the sole survivor of his team in
Survivor Series when they faced the Teamsters.

Execute the Razor's Edge
Out of the grapple, press the R button rapidly to get the desired move.
It is very cool to watch and will hurt very much to get hit with.

V.Strategies and Hints
1. If you don't have a controller with turbo on it, get one, it will 
immensly help you to get control of all of the various moves.  
2. To knockout the refree is mostly random, but I have been able to get it 
most of the time with this method.  When the ref is near the top of opposite 
ropes, start running toward him but right below him, so that you will catch 
him right as he is coming down to avoid you in the first place.  After that,
go rulebreak away :-)
3.In Tournament Mode(Tag Team or Singles), you can play around in the first
few matches, but after that, don't try to grapple to much, use the ropes,
and hit and move, and hit and move, to achieve the victory.  
4.For Tag Matches, when your opponent is low and energy and looks to tag, 
and looks to tag, cut off the ring, don't let him get the tag, and keep 
pounding on him.
5.More Tag Hints, if the ref is conscious, make sure that you are near the 
ropes but not too close, and that your opponent is inbetween you.  Atomic 
drop him and your tag team partner should start to choke him, this will 
allow you to pound on him some more.  If the ref is unconsious, the only
change is instead of the Atomic drop use the eye gouge(much more effective).
6.In the Royal Rumble, constantly rule break or throw your opponents into
the ropes.  Also try to avoid much contact as possible...as you will need
it for the entire Rumble.  And never climb the turnbuckle or start running 
around for no reason.  Unless you feel like playing with death(which I do 
sometimes with Macho Man)...but don't do it at first until you feel real 
sure.
