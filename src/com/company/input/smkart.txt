*************************** WHAT IS THIS? ****************************
**********************************************************************

Super Mario Kart came out in 1991 and I have been playing it for the
past two years.  One day, a friend and I were playing battle mode on
track 2, like we do on every Friday, discovering new techniques in the
game, and my friend says to me, "Boy, we should come up with an FAQ
for this game."  I laughed and then thought, hey, what a great idea.
So I figured it was high time someone put out an FAQ for this
delightful game.

Super Mario Kart is a 1-2 player game that consists of two play modes:
kart racing and kart battle mode.  You can race against one opponent,
one opponent and 6 computer opponents, or 7 computer opponents.  There
are also time trials for improving your race course times.  Combat
mode is 2 player only and can be played on any of the 4 specific
battle mode tracks.  For this edition of the FAQ, I'm mainly focusing
on the battle mode of Super Mario Kart.  Excelling at racing is best
done by just practicing.  I've included some racing tips in the Tips
and Tactics section but I hope to greatly expand the coverage in
future revisions.  Unequivocally, practicing the tips mentioned
herein will help you play better in race mode, and vice versa.

Although some basics, rules, and options are included in the FAQ, the
reader should have read the entire manual and have a good feel for the
game.

A record sheet cutout is included at the end of this FAQ.  Use it for
having tournaments between you and a friend.  I suggest recording your
games to tape and then later watching them with your friend to record
the stats.  A round averages around 45 minutes.

****************************** I LINGO *******************************
**********************************************************************

The following 17 items define the terms used in the record sheet at
the end of this FAQ.

Some stats affect other stats as well.  For example, ramming an
opponent into his own red shell when he fires it would count as a hit
by own red shell as well as ramming.  A 3 hit combo with 3 red shells
would also count as 3 hits by red shells.

01 + 02) COMBOS are valid if at least one hit is not random and the
    opponent could not avoid getting hit in succession because he was
    immobilized or had just begun to takeoff.  For example, the player
    gets hit by a random green shell and then the opponent moves in
    and fires a red shell for a second hit before the player gets a
    chance to recover.  This would count as a 2 hit combo.

03) RED SHELL HITS are collisions into red shells by karts.

04) GREEN SHELL HITS are valid on direct and indirect hits, rebounds
    off walls, as long as the shot was immediate and planned.  Firing
    a green shell so that it bounces from wall to wall down a corridor
    in hope of it hitting an opponent would not count as a green shell
    hit.

05) Rare hits by an opponent who throws, not drops, a banana peel
    which hits the opponent or is thrown in front of the opponent who
    can not avoid driving over it is a BANANA PEEL HIT.

06) DROP SHELLS include driving in front of an opponent and laying a
    green shell or banana peel so the opponent can not avoid driving
    over it.

07) When a pursuing opponent enables star power, hitting an opponent
    counts as a STAR HIT.

08) Sometimes, a player's own red shell that he fired will hit his own
    kart.  This can occur if the opponent drives near the player who
    fired the shell.

09) RANDOM COLLISIONS include hitting a rogue green shell or driving
    over a dropped shell or banana peel (one that was not placed
    purposely by opponent so he hits it).  Also hitting one's own
    green shell that was just fired is a random collision.

10) RAMMING is hitting an opponent's kart with one's own which results
    in a hit into a red or green shell, or banana peel.  Also,
    blocking an opponent's path so he gets hit by an oncoming green
    shell.  These do not count as random collisions.

11) AMATEUR MISTAKES occur by a player when the opponent shoots or
    drops an item to hit another oncoming item.  Includes shooting an
    oncoming red or green shell with another red or green shell or
    dropping a green shell or banana peel to disarm an oncoming red or
    green shell from behind.  Disarming a green shell only counts if
    the danger was immediate.  The firing opponent should be able to
    tell that these shots would not have hit the opponent assuming the
    player is competent enough.

12) RED SHELL SHAKES, also known as "OK"s, include eluding an oncoming
    red shell that would have hit the opponent.  Shakes do not include
    just going around the corner or poor shots by the pursuing
    opponent.  Lining the wall is a red shell shake as is jumping
    shells (not with feathers) or leading them into your opponent,
    other items, or walls.  Subjective criteria.

13) Occasionally, a red shell will be fired at such an angle at a
    standing opponent, the shell will circle the opponent and be
    unable to hit the kart.

14) A FAST TAKEOFF occurs when a player times reving his engine before
    the green light hits so the takeoff is as fast as using a
    mushroom.

15) A SUCCESSFUL STEAL is when a player uses his ghost when the
    opponent has an item in his position.

16) A QUIT is purposely hitting start and selecting give up cause
    either
    a) The karter is a baby or
    b) To deprive the opponent of the satisfaction of finishing him.

17) A player can have a FLAWLESS VICTORY if he wins 1 game without
    losing any balloons.

GAME - One game played opponent vs opponent with winning as a result
of 3 hits on opponent.

KARTER - That's you!

LAKITU - 'The cloud rider' is the guy that sits in the cloud and helps
you out by pulling you out of the water, informing you that you are
driving the wrong way in race mode, and holds the race light in race
and battle mode.

LINING THE WALL - One technique to avoiding an oncoming red shell, is
to drive along the side of the wall.  If done correctly, the red shell
will hit the wall, not you, no matter how fast or slow the shell is
traveling.  As you drive parallel to the wall, you'll notice that
about half of your kart can drive in the wall.  This technique rarely
works for head-on red shells fired at an angle.

MATCH - Best of X Rounds.

POWER SLIDES - The kart will enter a slide when it is turned in excess
and if held, spin-out.

PROFESSIONAL PUNISHMENT - When an player does not follow through in
creating an amateur mistake by canceling an oncoming shell, it is
called a PROFESSIONAL PUNISHMENT by the pursuing opponent.

ROUND - First player to win 15 games.  A player must win by at least 2
games, otherwise, round continues.

TIME BOMB - Purposely firing a red shell slowly so that it hits the
opponent at a later time.  Used to follow an opponent who is unaware
that it is following him to set up for a combo, for an opponent that
is lining a wall to avoid it and anticipates its demise incorrectly,
or for an opponent weaving around corners only to connect with it.
It can sometimes be harder to hit an opponent with a fast red shell
than with a slow incoming one.

PENALTY SHOT - If you think certain tactics in the game are cheap, set
up PENALTY SHOTS.  Have one kart at the outer edge and corner of the
track, and another kart at the other corner.  The penalized kart must
sit and wait while the opponent kart gets one free standing shot with
a green shell.  The Penalized kart can set his kart anywhere between
the two walls of the corridor as long as the back of the kart touches
the back wall and the opponent has a clear shot.  Neither kart is
allowed to move during the penalty shot.  Both karts are allowed to
move after the green shell either hits or misses.  The penalized kart
is not allowed to hold onto any items.  Use PENALTY SHOTS for an
opponent who selects quit in a middle of a game, messes with the
opponent's controller, and other unethical tactics.

              kart and cause you to lose time.
Monty mole -  Jumps out of the ground and attaches to the front of
              your kart slowing you.  If he grabs you, jump repeatedly
              to detach him or go in the water.
Flowers    -  These sit around the edges of the track.

MARIO LUIGI PRINCESS YOSHI DONKEY KONG JR. BOWSER KOOPA TROOPA TOAD

The most important factors for battle mode seems to be handling (ie
ease of which the kart makes a turn) and acceleration.  Top speed
isn't much of a concern in battle mode since you are bound to hit
walls a lot.  Koopa and Toad are my personal favorites because their
karts have quick responses and can turn a full 180 quickly.  As the
chart shows below, the best combined score for steering and
acceleration is Koopa Troopa and Toad with Princess and Yoshi
following.  All the characters are pretty good and selection is a
personal preference.  About the only characters I don't recommend for
battle modes are Bowser & Donkey Kong Jr. because of their poor
acceleration which sets them up for some massive combos.  I recommend
Princess and Yoshi for race mode.

**************** IV DESCRIPTION OF BATTLE MODE TRACKS ****************
**********************************************************************

The second track, my favorite, has good maneuvering, good way to
locate an opponent, a wide open space for some fun dodging of red
shells, and a quick way to pursue an opponent with a relatively large
playing field.  The water makes this track really unique.  The first
track, your tires tend not to grip as much and you slide sideways on
turns.  Not good if you're trying to build speed and keep bumping the
walls.  The play field is also the smallest of all tracks.  The third
track has about as good traction as the 2nd but the karts tend to
spin-out much more easily.  Although track 4 has the best traction,
there are too many walls to really do much turning although it is the
easiest to locate your opponent of all tracks.  Expect long games on
this track.

- Using Koopa as a standard to judge tracks.
- 4/4 indicates one full circle turn.
- Sliding is immediate if you touch dirt.
                                         
            Track 1  Track 2  Track 3  Track 4
slide       4/4      3/4      1/4      4/4
spin-out    6/4      4/4      2/4      12/4


Track 2 Comparisons

            Koopa & Toad Mario & Luigi Kong & Bowser Yoshi & Princess
slide       3/4          2/4           2/4            1/4
spin-out    4/4          3/4           3/4            2/4

On the more traction tracks, you have to adjust your technique for
turning.  Hitting jump but letting go early and steering the rest of
the way with just the pad seems to work excellently with minimal loss
of speed.

***************************** V SECRETS ******************************
**********************************************************************

RACING WITH YOUR SHADOW
-----------------------
As noted on page 33 of the Super Mario Kart manual, "If you race well
enough in the TIME TRIALS, then choose the same course again, you may
be able to race against yourself!"


GHOST RACER
-----------
Select Time Trial and hit start on controller 2.  There will be a
player with the word "COM" above him or her.  Next, select your player
and select the computer player.  Start the Time Trail and you will see
that the COM driver is really a computer controlled ghost driver that
will be racing with you in the Time Trail competition.  If the ghost
driver wins the race, it will not affect your time in any way.  This
is an intelligent pace kart.  If you drive slow, it will drive slow
keeping just in front of you.  If you drive fast, it will stay on your
tail.


SCREEN ROTATION
---------------
Select Time Trial.  Choose your player and go to the track of your
choice.  While racing, be careful not to hit anything.  Get a good
time and then access the Replay option. While in Replay mode press the
L or R buttons to rotate the screen. You can do this on any level in
Time Trail!

Try this, get a good time so you can race with your shadow, and then
the second time, get a good time without hitting anything and watch
the replay rotating the screen on both of your characters.  You can
not have a computer ghost racer and your shadow race with you at the
same time.


MINI KARTS
----------
Shrink characters in Grand Prix or Match Races.  Hold down the Y
button, then press button A while on the Character Selection screen.
Again to enlarge the characters.  Note, the other racers will remain
big, only the selected characters will be small.


DISABLING MUSIC
---------------
Turn off the music during battle mode and race mode.  Hit the start
key, on either controller, very quickly and repeatedly until you do
not hear any music.  The sound effects will still be there.  The music
will turn itself back on if you use a star.


**********************************************************************
******************* VI FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS ********************
**********************************************************************

Q:  Why is it sometimes I fire a shell it goes slow, and other times
    it goes fast?

A:  The speed of a shell is directly proportional to the speed of the
    kart at the time of firing.  A shell can be outrun if the firing
    kart is stationary or moving at a very slow velocity.  Of course
    it also depends on the top speed of the pursued kart.


Q:  Why do I keep getting my butt kicked in battle mode?

A:  Because you suck?  No?  Well then...
    As you record your games on the record sheet, you'll see that it's
    red shells that kill your opponent more than any other object so
    the more red shells you get, the better your chances.  Even if
    your opponent is a better shooter and shaker, the bottom line is,
    if you get significantly more red shells, you'll end up on top.
    Basically, if you get an object and it's not a red shell, lose it
    if there are ample free question marks, and try again.  Of course
    this is not a good idea if you have a green shell and your
    opponent has a red shell and is nearby.


Q:  How do you do a fast takeoff?

A:  As soon as you hear the first beep (not see the light), hit and
    hold the accelerator.  Don't hit or tap the accelerator before the
    lights light up.  If your motor is running at all when the first
    light hits, you'll have to hit the accelerator slightly later than
    usual for a fast takeoff.


Q:  I could have sworn my shell went right through my opponent.  Is it
    a bug or can you jump shells?

A:  No, you can not jump shells or banana peels.  For a shell to hit,
    it must be centered on the back of the kart.  Often what happens
    is, the shell will appear to come directly at the kart, but if you
    record and play back the animation, you will see the shell will
    pass slightly off center from behind.  This is not always the case
    however.  If you time firing your shell, your shell and your kart
    can pass right through your opponent.  Fire the shell just before
    you collide with your opponent.  This and other shells going
    through your opponent are most likely bugs.


Q:  Cool, my partner is being picked up by Lakitu to be put back on
    the track and I have a green shell but I don't know where Lakitu
    will put him?

A:  There seems to be certain magic spots the clouds will drop you on.
    If you are past a certain mark, it will always advance you to the
    next magic spot clockwise, even if there is a closer one counter-
    clockwise so keep this in mind.  When you see Lakitu, go to your
    partners location, face right and then just follow Lakitu enough
    to get a good shot.  There seems to be an exception to this when
    two karts are being picked up by Lakitu to be placed on the same
    magic spot.  If this is the case, one kart will go to the nearest
    magic spot clockwise, and the other to the nearest magic spot
    counterclockwise.


Q:  It seems the question marks are placed randomly after each match
    or at least when I turn the machine off especially on track 1 of
    battle mode.  Does it?

A:  No, all the question marks have been placed and saved at a
    permanent location.


Q:  What determines when the question marks get reset?

A:  Don't know.  Maybe when all the question marks have been taken
    (except the ones in the puddles of track 2) or after a certain
    amount of time has transpired.


Q:  How long does a shell and peel last?

A:  Varies.  Have not been able to determine what makes some shells
    last longer than others.  May have to do with how active the
    players are and how many other items are on the playing field.


Q:  How long does invisibility last?

A:  20 seconds.


Q:  How long does invincibility last?

A:  10 seconds.


Q:  What's the best strategy against an evasive opponent when I got a
    star?

A:  Get as close to him as possible, preferably in an open area and
    make sure there are some free question marks nearby.  Then, enable
    star power mode and immediately start getting objects.  If you get
    a red shell, you may have set yourself up for at least a 2 hit
    combo on your opponent, 3 if you hit your opponent correctly with
    your kart.  Remember, you have superior braking powers when you
    have a star.  After you hit your opponent at full speed, you can
    always break to avoid flying past him or if your opponent is
    trying to be cute by slowing down to let you pass, hit brake, line
    up, and then charge.  He won't know what hit him.


Q:  How do you hit the opponent correctly with star power?

A:  For the combo, if you hit the opponent slightly off, you will be
    thrown off and will have to waste time turning around to come in
    for another hit which may give your opponent enough time to get
    away.  If you are almost out of time, charge full speed head on
    and as straight as possible and you may get multiple hits on one
    pass, otherwise, come in slowly, hit, turn your kart slightly, hit
    again.  For those who think combos are cheap, I say, they are
    rare, and each opponent has equal chance to do it.  It's just
    another "feature" to be mastered.


Q:  Somehow I got a red shell to circle me.  What do I do now?

A:  Oh boy, this is a tough one.  You've got to respond immediately.
    You cannot give your opponent time to get another shell or ram
    you.  If it's slow enough, you might want to try to build speed
    inside the encompassing area the shell has created and then make
    a break for it to a wall as soon as the red shell passes in front
    of you.  You may get lucky and be able to get a question mark
    inside the circle.  If worse comes to worse, get yourself hit to
    avoid being comboed on by your opponent.


Q:  A red shell is on my tail.  What do I do?

A:  You can do several things.  Outrun it.  Line the wall.  Jump into
    the wall at the last possible moment.  Drop a shell or banana peel
    if you have one, if not try to obtain an item because virtually
    any item you get will be able to help you.  About the only thing
    that can't help you is a red shell.  If it's wiggling but moving
    fast on you, jump like crazy.  The shell will often get confused
    and make a sharp turn to come around for another pass.  Hopefully
    its turn will lead it into a wall.  Most importantly, if you are
    in the center of the track when a red shell is coming at you, head
    for the nearest wall full speed and then don't stop turning and
    jumping, that or line the wall if you have time and can do it
    accurately.


Q:  Shoot!  A red shell is coming right at me head on.  What do I do?

A:  If you got a shell (green or red), wait until the last possible
    nanosecond before firing your shell at the red shell to kill it.
    You do not have to be perfectly lined up for this to work
    although, the more lined up you are, the earlier you can fire the
    shell to intercept.  When firing red shells, it's still best to
    wait until the last possible moment as they might rear off and
    miss their target.


Q:  Does the Karting Kombat continue in a sequel?

A:  As far as Nintendo reports, they are not working on and have no
    plans to create a sequel.  However, Wacky Karts is slated for a
    release on the IBM PC.  Although different characters appear, the
    same mode 7, graphics, and combat game play seem to be there.
    Watch for it.  Although some have said that Stunt Race FX was to
    be the expected sequel to Super Mario Kart, the two are really
    different games, especially in battle mode.


**********************************************************************
************************* VII TIPS & TACTICS *************************
**********************************************************************

Practice firing green shells on turns at an angle that can send it
straight down a corridor.

Practice making turns without slowing down and hitting walls.  The
best way to make a turn is to hit the jump button coming up on a turn
and then turn in that direction.  Sometimes you may need to jump more
than once.

Practice lining the wall on the fly.

When you get hit by a shell, hold the gas and hit the jump button.  It
seems hitting the jump button will break you out of dizzy spell
quicker.

After making a jump and turning, if you hold the jump button you will
be at more of an angle.  Try this on track 2.  Start yourself in a
circle, then jump and hold the button.  After you release the button
you'll notice your kart straighten up a little.  Keep this in mind
when you have a red shell and are being pursued.  You can use this to
your advantage to make a quick 180.  Remember, you don't have to be
fully turned around for your shell to turn around.

It is possible to drop a shell or peel on top of a sitting opponent
and other shells and peels.

Remember, you can't spin-out when you are invincible.

Learn to tell, by the music, when exactly invincibility will run out.

As you near an opponent, if you shoot the shell just before you hit
him, you and your shell will pass right through your opponent.

If you are sitting right next to your opponent (whether sideways,
behind, etc) and fire a shell, the shell will pass right through your
opponent.  Be careful.  Firing a red shell like this will undoubtedly
cause it to loop around and hit you!

You are not immune to your own red shells that you have fired.  If
your opponent has fired a red shell and and is standing still or
moving slowly, you might want to try to whip by your opponent and hope
that as the red shell is coming around for a pass to hit you by
following you, it takes the same path and hits your opponent.  I
usually have this happen once every couple rounds.

Use the colors on the map to quickly locate your opponent and move in
for the kill.  Counterclockwise  Red - Yellow - Green - Blue

The manual that comes with the cartridge has a few useful hints listed
on page 17,18, and 33 for battle mode tactics and tips.


RACING TIPS
-----------

Power slides slow your kart down.  Rather, to do a more efficient
turn, drive on the outside of the track and take the turn close on the
inside (like they do in formula 1 racing).  Perfect it so you don't
slide or hit the wall.  If you think you can't make it at the speed
you are going, try letting go of the gas, or better yet, tap the gas
which will slow the kart down yet still keep you at the fastest speed
coming out of the turn.

I recommend using Yoshi and Princess for the best results in race mode
once you have learned the tracks.  While Donkey Kong and Bowser have
the best top speed, hitting other opponents and walls can be costly
and you are bound to have it happen on the 100cc and 150cc races.
Beginners should stick with Koopa and Toad because they are easiest to
handle and can recover from crashes quickly.

Practice, practice, practice.  Learn where all the turns are so you
can anticipate where your kart should be for best turns.


**********************************************************************
***************************** VIII DON'T *****************************
**********************************************************************

Don't pursue an opponent in an open area (as in track 2) when you have
a star and he has a red shell.  This is suicide because with practice,
an opponent can estimate when invincibility will run out by the music
so the opponent can fire the shell while you are still invincible and
it will hit right after invincibility runs out giving you no time to
make your escape.  Either pursue for a reasonable amount of time or
more intelligently, obtain items to fire at your opponent.

Don't hold on to a ghost indefinitely.  The opposing player can just
continue jumping or avoiding question marks.  Although it's probably
somewhat cheap, it's sometimes advisable to use a feather to wait out
an opponent's invincibility in a puddle.  If you got a ghost during
the pursuit by an opponent with enabled star power, I suggest holding
onto it in case the opponent gets a red shell.  Otherwise, if he is
near, use it to avoid capture.

Don't underestimate red shells.  I've thought I've lost some fast
moving red shell only to get hit by it a minute and 5 corners later.

Don't ever give up.  Even if your opponent is waiting with a red shell
and you are being brought in out of the water by Lakitu, jump like
crazy and for the wall.  You'll be surprised what you can avoid
sometimes and soon it'll be the norm to avoid red shells, rather than
get hit by them.


**********************************************************************
************************ IX VARYING GAME PLAY ************************
**********************************************************************

Have a contest to see who can kill themselves first.  Hint, if you
have a green shell or banana peel, go full speed into a wall and just
before you hit the wall, drop the shell or peel.  If done right,
you'll bounce off the wall and into the shell or peel killing
yourself.

Allow no use of red shells.  Vary the items you can use to tweak your
aiming skills.

When you spin-out, use the star and you will continue to drive
straight with your kart turned on its side until you steer.

Get a star, build as much speed as possible, get a feather, then jump
into the water on track 2.  After you land, keep driving.  Yes, you
can drive underwater.  See how far you can drive out.

Hip Hop the tiles on track 2 that hold the puddles of water.  If you
do it right, you can hop tiles until the corner and you will bounce
backwards, hopping the tiles backwards.  Sometimes this can continue
for several hops.

Practice having red shells chase you.  I've had 4 on my tail.

Practice having red shells loop immobile opponents.  I've had up to 4.

Hit jump just before you die.  It will make your kart do jumps after
he is dead adinfinitum.

After you die, don't release the gas button, instead keep your kart
going.  You can continue to pickup items and shoot them at your
opponent.  On a couple occasions, after I was killed, my kart suddenly
took on a life of its own.  The kart would drive itself around the
track as if the computer was controlling it.  The demo does show
computer players battling it out in battle mode.  This makes me wonder
why Nintendo didn't have computer opponents in battle mode instead of
just leaving it as a 2 player only mode.

If there is a banana peel laying on the outside of the track, it is
still possible to hit it by jumping onto it using a feather.

**********************************************************************
*********************** XI FUTURE ENHANCEMENTS ***********************
**********************************************************************

Get rid of the shadow when you are invisible.  How fake.

Random amount of time you stay invincible.

Invisibility to red shell sensors.

Possibility to get hit by banana peels in mid air.

Have banana peels float in the water as possible hazards.

A countdown timer.

More tracks with obstacles and non-level surfaces.

Lots of variable settings including time, balloons, etc.

New characters.  How about the Mortal Kombat characters driving the
karts.

Ability to machine gun green shells or drop multiple banana peels.

Item to make you a big kart to squash your opponent.

Multiplayer combat over the modem.

Ability to guide direction of a green shell after firing and just
before it hits a wall by holding a button and pushing a direction.

SOAD Shells (Seek out and destroy) - Superior intelligent but slower
red shells.  These shells won't blindly go into a wall but will seek
you out around corners until either they make contact (and I don't
mean ask questions now and shoot later), disappear, or hit another
object including the other kart.  These shells have the ability to
adjust their speed (but do have a maximum of less than the karts
maximum speed) so a hovering kart is in for a treat when it lands from
a feather.

Colored shells.  These shells are like green shells only they can pass
through karts that are not of the same color.

Ability to fire shells from all 4 sides of the kart not just dropping
them.  This would make it much more difficult to hit an immobilized
opponent as he could shoot an incoming shell easier.  Would add to
strategy of staying on an opponent's tail or side.  Watch out!

Little shells.  These don't actually pop balloons but stick on the
opponent for some time causing the kart to be reduced in maximum
speed.  3 little shells will cause a balloon to pop.

Computer opponents allowing for 1 to 4 players and 4 human player
capability using the 4 player game adapter.

After ending a game in battle mode, make the default position of the
cursor on RETRY, not CHANGE COURSE as RETRY is probably the most
selected option.  Irritating how I keep hitting CHANGE COURSE every
time.

Change the default.  Hitting the button alone drops a banana peel but
fires a shell.  Make it so hitting fire throws a banana peel and shell
and pushing down drops a peel and shell.

Option to reconfigure buttons.

Option for manual shifting

Add seasons and time of day options.

AND MOST IMPORTANTLY, REVERSE FOR THE KARTS!!!!!!


If you got more ideas for the sequel, corrections, comments, or things
to add to the FAQ, email us.  I'll add them and then see Nintendo
receives this archive in hopes of a sequel.


HAPPY KARTING !!!

*********************** XII THE MK COMPARISON ************************
**********************************************************************

Mario Kart & Mortal Kombat really do have a lot in common.

* Both have acronyms MK.

* Both have fun combative 2 player competition.

* Both are my favorite games.

* Both are cool and have lots of features.

* Both have long lasting appeal.

* Both you try to kill your opponent by taking down energy.

* Both have several characters to select from.

* Both have secrets.

* Both have projectiles.

* Both have nearly identical looking prices
  Mario Kart     $40.00
  Mortal Kombat  $4000


Go figure that one would be made by Nintendo and the other by a US
company.
