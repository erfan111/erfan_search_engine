==============================================================================
Part Three - What's New in World Heroes 2 Jet
==============================================================================
- Dio seems to be missing, and Zeus has taken Dio's place as the last boss.
  Shame...Dio was a cool character. Perhaps SNK have ported a character from
  another SNK beat 'em up and placed him or her as a last boss, like Ryo from
  AOF was placed in FFS, and Geese from FF2 was placed in AOF2. Zeus is a poor
  choice for a boss. He is boring to play against. Three-Four hits and you are
  dead as a doornail.

- Ryofu and Jack can be used.
  Pretty unoriginal characters...fairly dull and plain. Ryofu has some
  originality, but Jack is a total rip off Vega from SF2 (Balrog in Japan)

- Character alterations.
  As with SSF2T, WH2J has been altered for better close range battles, but,
  unlike SSF2T, WH2J hasn't evened out the character that much, with Dragon
  being able to beat everybody easy.

- Gameplay sped up.
  Yay...but I still wish it could be faster...Speed is what is needed these
  days...with the King of this genre, SFII, speeding up all the time, the
  World Heroes series will be left behind. The slow never win.

- Increased AI.
  Yay! But its still too easy, even on the hardest mode. Could learn from
  Super Street Fighter II Turbo. Also, the CPU doesn't seem to deflect
  projectiles as much as it used to in World Heroes 2. Just don't let the
  computer do any combos on you.

- New "Tournament Mode" and "Vs World Heroes Mode".
  Somehow, I think that they should have left death match in and not have put
  the vs World Heroes...death match was pretty original and fun to play.

- Character type select in two player mode.
  One of the new innovations in this genre of games.

- All blocked hits take off energy.
  This is kinda a la Mortal Kombat. It sort of makes the special moves in the
  game not so 'special' any more, even the gameplay has been affected.

- More cinematic scenes.
  Somewhat a waste of work, as most players I know just skip them...not very
  good either.

- New endings? 
  Somebody confirm this...I never get the chance to look at them.

- Throwing much harder to do.
  See "The Infamous Button C..."

- New Colours for the characters?
  Help me with this...

- New introduction
  Basically, they did a very poor job on the intro. Hardly anything
  impressive, very jerky. Could learn from the intro in Super Street Fighter
  II Turbo which the best so far, and could even learn from World Heroes 2.

- New sounds/music
  Sometimes I wish that they could get a decent voice for the characters. I
  really hate how they use someone with a bad American accent who is most
  likely to be Japanese to do the voices. When Rasputin is supposed to say
  "Axel Spin" he says, "Gaosfg Spid" or something like that...why can't they
  get proper voices for the characters. For example, for Brocken, get a fella
  who speaks German with a proper German accent and get him to say things in
  German, not English...I mean, it would make more sense if Brocken spoke
  German and not english, plus, it would be way cool.

- Overall.
  WH2J is a good game, but not good enough to challange the giant of this
  genre, the Street Fighter series. The World Heroes series has been one that
  basically copies the Street Fighter series, with a few streaks of 
  originality, like the death match. If there is a WH3, SNK would have to
  totally revamp the whole game. If there is no WH3, nobody would really be
  complaining. IMHO, SNK should concentrate on the Fatal Fury series and 
  Samurai Shodown/Spirits series. In particular, the Samurai Shodown series.

==============================================================================
Part Four - Entry Into Tournament
==============================================================================
You basically fight all sixteen characters and the boss character in
Tournament mode. However, you don't really get a lot of time for your money,
as you only fight most of the characters once.

First you fight twelve of the characters, divided up into four groups of three
characters. These four groups will be placed in random order. When you fight a
group, you fight the characters one round each. If you lose against two
opponents in one group, you are out of the game. However, if you win against
either two or three opponents in a group, you advance to the next group.

After you defeat all four groups. You then fight Captain Kidd, Hanzou, Jack,
Ryofu and Zeus in that order. But the difference between these five characters
and the previous twelve is that you fight these five characters the best out
of three rounds.

And if you succeed, you finsh the game.

These are the first four battles you fight placed from hardest to easiest
(IMHO)...I think when you fight them, the battles are in random order.

- Shura, Kim Dragon, Fuuma (The Elite)
- Ryoko, Julius Carn, Janne (The Cheaters)
- Mudman, Brocken, Rasputin (The Weirdos)
- Johnny Maximum, Muscle Power, Erick (The Big Boys)

Then you fight these battles.

- Captain Kidd
- Hanzou
- Jack
- Ryofu
- Zeus

==============================================================================
Part Five - Vs World Heroes Mode
==============================================================================
Never ever choose this mode, as it wastes your money. It basically lets you
fight against four (I think) characters, best out of three rounds, then the
machine says game over...I only tried this once and never will again.

==============================================================================
Part Six - Player One Vs Player Two
==============================================================================
This is a fairly cool idea, but I have no idea why they bothered.

Speedy - Only use this if you are playing against a totally crappy
         opponent.

Normal - Use this if your character is the medium to fast speed.

Offensive - Use this if your character is the powerful type.

Defensive - Don't use this.

==============================================================================
Part Seven - The Infamous Button C, Throwing and Faking
==============================================================================
Remember in World Heroes and World Heroes 2 when you could throw your 
character just by hitting button C? Well, those days are over in World 
Heroes 2 Jet. Now the only way you can throw is by getting close and
pressing forward or backward and one of the attack buttons. Tis a shame
that throw reversals have been taken out. Throwing is now like Mortal
Kombat...by the time you get close enough to throw the computer, the
computer would already have thrown you.

Button C is now used for 'fake' or 'attract' where you fake a dizzy to
attract your opponent to hit you. If you just hit button C, you will do
some sort of weirdo pose. If you press down and button C, you will fake a
dizzy. This is fairly useful as you can attack out of your dizzy, so 
basically, fake a dizzy, wait for you opponent to come close, then SMACK!

The other buttons remain as normal - Button A for punch, button B for kick
and button D is the button that you press if you have nothing better to
do...i.e. it does nothing.

==============================================================================
Part Eight - Movement
==============================================================================
Movement can charge towards your opponent or retreat from him or her, without
them, life would be pretty still.

Generally, Jumping forwards and backwards would be your main form of movement,
as it is the fastest and most combos start with a jumping attack. Jumping
directly up is also possible. Jumping directly up is done by pressing your
joystick in the up position. Jumping backward is done by pressing your
joystick in the up-backwards position. Jumping backward is done by pressing
your joystick in the up-forwards position. Note that jumping is done from
the ground.

Walking is the next form of movement. It is done my holding the joystick
in either a  -O  or  O-  position, while on the ground.

Dashing is new in World Heroes 2 Jet. It basically is running either backwards
or forwards. Just tap twice the way you wish to go. For example, if you want
to dash backwards, tap backwards twice. Different characters have different
dashes. The Ninjas slide, Rasputin warps...etc.

==============================================================================
Part Nine - Attacks
==============================================================================
Without attacks, there is no way to win a battle in World Heroes. Attacking is
to try to hit your opponent. There are three main attacks, punches, kick and
special moves.

Punches are generally hits with the hand or arm. This is done by pressing
button A. There are two main types of punches, weak and strong. Weak punches
are done by tapping on the A button, whereas strong punches are done by
pressing on button A. Kicks are done in the same fashion, but with button B.
i.e., Weak kicks are tapping on button B, strong kicks are pressing button B.
These punches and kicks can produce several different punches and kicks. They
can be done while jumping in the air, while on the ground, while holding the
joystick in a certain direction. Best to experiment.

Special moves are slightly different. Special moves require a certain motion
to be done by the joystick, then a button is pressed, either punch or kick.
As with punches and kicks, special moves can be weak or strong, depending
whether you tapped or pressed the button.

Different attacks produce different effects on opponents when hit. Some
attacks will burn them, some will electricute them, some will make them
stumble backwards, some will make them fall back. Experiment to see what they
do.

When you and your opponent attack each other at exactly the same time, when
you come into contact with each other, you will clash. This means that when
they come into contact with each other, they will lock up, sparks will be seen
at the point of contact, then you repel each other, bouncing back. No damage
is done, or recived.

==============================================================================
Part Ten - Defense
==============================================================================
Defense is a very important part of playing World Heroes 2 Jet. Defending is
basically blocking an attack. This is done by holding the joystick in the
opposite direction in which it the attack is coming from, and most of the
time, that would be backwards. A high block is done by pushing the joystick
directly backwards, and a low block is done by pushing the joystick in a
down-backwards, diagonal position. Low blocks are used for blocking low
attacks, and high blocks are used for blocking high attacks.

This does not mean that everytime you press backwards, you will do a high
block, or everytime you press down-backwards, you will do a low block. Blocks
only occur when your character is being attacked. For example. If you press
backwards when your opponent is not attacking, you will walk backwards. If
you press backwards when your opponent is attacking, and in range, you will
block.

This does not mean, as long as you block every single attack, you will be
safe. Energy will still be taken off your energy bar if you block an attack,
but the energy taken off is little when compared to unblocked attacks. Note
that energy will only be taken off if your opponent makes contact with you.
Blocks are useless against throws. If you a blocking, and your opponent wishes
to throw you, there is no way you can block a throw.

There is a special kind of defense called projectile deflection. This means
that when your opponent throws a projectile at you, you can deflect it, and
reverse the projectile's course, sending it back to your opponent. This is
done by waiting for the projectile to come towards you, then pressing
backwards just before the projectile comes into contact with your character.

* The Rekko Zan has been worsened by a longer recovery period.

* The multiple Rekko Zan seems to be much easier to do, having more time to
  execute the move, but I know of no one who has been able to pull off a
  triple weak Rekko Zan.

* The Ko Ryu Ha has been boosted in speed, but reduced in range, it now has a
  different effect on the opponent it hits.

* The weak Ninpoh Koh Rin Ka Zan has remained the same, while the strong
  Ninpoh Koh Rin Ka Zan has been boosted in power, range and speed. It now
  flies up into the air for a while, then decends quickly, knocking opponents
  down.

* Nothing has changed for the Ninja Leg Lariot.

* Hanzou's new move, the MijinKakure-no Jutsu is a teleport that transports
  him about a third across the screen. It doesn't have much offensive
  potential, since it is too slow, but is useful for avoiding attacks and
  getting out of a corner.

Style       - Fuuma Ninjitsu
Nationality - Japanese (Japan)

* As with Hanzou's Rekko Zan, Fuuma's Reppu Zan is now a worsened move with
  longer recovery time.

* Similar to Hanzou's Multiple Rekko Zan, Fuuma's Multiple Reppu Zan is easier
  to do, but getting a triple weak Reppu Zan is hard.

* Fuuma's En Ryu Ha seems to lack the range of Hanzou's Ko Ryu Ha, but the
  ability for Fuuma to execute the En Ryu Ha in mid air is a good boost to the
  move.

* The Ninpoh Fu Rin Ka Zan has not been altered.

* Fuuma's new move, the BakuretsuKyuukyokuKen is an air-to-ground attack.
  Fuuma leaps up into the air, engulfing himself in a aura of flame then
  charging down at a forty-five degree angle. It is a bit slow to be of much
  use as an offensive weapon but can be used in the defensive style like
  Hanzou's MijinKakure-no Jutsu.

Kim Dragon's new moves are all kicks and they are fairly useful. His
TobiSokuToh is a either a charging single powerful kick or a several
charging weak kicks followed by a powerful kick, depending on the strength
of the attack. The powerful kick will knock any unblocked opponent to the
side of the screen. Very useful for finshing combos and cornering. His
HiryuuKyaku is a anti-air and air-to-ground kick. Dragon leaps up into the
air, kicking upwards, then when Dragon reaches to peak of his jump, he
comes charging downwards at a forty-five degree angle, kicking down. His
HyakuretsuShuu is a multi-hit sationary anti-air attack. It is fairly
powerful, but timing of the execution of this move must be precise to get
the most out of this. It can leave Dragon open to attack if not executed
correctly.

J. Carn's new move, the Mongolian Attack is similar to Janne's Justice
Sword, as it serves as an anti-air attack and a charging attack. Carn 
rolls-up into a ball and leaps into the air, and decending onto opponents.
Carn's Mongolian Press is a fast and powerful charging move. Carn leaps
up into the air, then decending on opponents butt-first. Very useful if
Carn is a fair distance away and wants to get close quickly. This move,
however is very prone to anti-air attacks.

Brocken's Rocket Punch, although not new, has been given new animation.
His new move, the Jack Hammer, is a charging, multiple hit move that looks
cool, but does weak damage. I like using it for finshing a round. His
Long Spark Thunder is just a extended version of the Spark Thunder. I
always seem to miss.

Style       - Savate
Nationality - British

(Written by Marc Michaels)
Fast and generally very sneaky, Jack has the weirdest moves in the game. The
Mixer Crush is an opponent homing move that, once executed will take the
shortest route to his opponent's head, for a six hitting move. Jack's Jaws of
Death is a horribly weird move where Jack goes underground with his claws
sticking out. <ZC-This move has some offensive potential but I use it for
getting out of sticky situtions.> Jack's Iron Crawl is a ridiculous move where
Jack falls to the ground and starts crawling with his blades flinging up into
the air. The Knee Smasher forces Jack to make a hole in opponent's bodies with
a sharp spike on his leg.

Style       - ?
Nationality - Chinese

(Written by Marc Michaels)
Lacking in speed, Ryofu uses his power, in combination with the extra power
and long range of his spear to devastate opponents. His Psychic Kick is a
charging move where he leaps up into the air and charges down with his spear.
His Spear Head Boogie is a so-so anti-air move where Ryofu's spear engulfs in
flames and he starts swinging it around. His Fists of Flame is a semi-
projectile move where Ryofu blows a flame that roasts at thing it touches. And
his Spear of Destruction is a multi-hit move that cause massive headaches for
any idiot who walks into it.
