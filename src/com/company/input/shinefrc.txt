K) STRATEGY

 1. Concentrate your forces on a few enemies at a time so as to kill
    them quickly.

 2. Use healers freely for healing and other spells.

 3. Use medical herbs and healing seeds.

 4. Combine attackers whose combined damage just suffices to kill their
    enemy.

 5. When fighting indoors, consider circling around rather than charging
    directly at the leader.

 6. It is seldom useful to withdraw from a won battle and fight it again
    for the sake of experience points.  It may be helpful to do so to get
    more coins and weapons from the enemy.

 7. A member with the Mobility Ring and the Power Ring can equip the
    Mobility Ring to advance far, then equip the Power Ring in the same
    move to attack hard.

 8. If you must have a Jogurt Ring, set Jogurt to fight the Artillery
    units in Pao Prairie and outside Balbazak's fortress.

L) ANSWERS

 1. The members' initial statistics are somewhat random.  So are their
    gains.
 2. You usually cannot gain an enemy's possessions after defeating him.
 3. Jogurt appears to be worthless.  He cannot rise above Experience
    Level 1.

M) OBSCURITIES

 1. After Guardiana is overrun you can visit the castle's treasury
    and help yourself.
 2. Search in Manarina to find the Domingo Egg.
 3. Arthur joins only after you win Battle 6.
 4. Search Kokichi's apparatus in Bustoke and he will give you a
    demonstration.
 5. Boken, whom you meet in Rindo, Bustoke, and Waral, is useless,
    except for releasing you from your cell in Prompt.  So is
    the husband's offer to join after the battle in the quarry.
 6. Jogurt joins tacitly when you first enter the chapel in Pao I.
 7. Vankar is left behind when Pao I departs; you can enlist him
    only then.
 8. You can hatch the Domingo Egg only in the Item Shop in Pao II.
 9. Step on the big fish in Waral to meet Boken.
10. When you visit the King of Waral after the battle in Ring Reef,
    you will leave Waral at once without visiting any more shops.
11. Find Bleu in Dragonia before you talk with Kane and visit
    Headquarters.
12. The chests in Dragonia can be looted both during battle and
    before or after battle.
13. Musashi joins only when you read a sign on a wall in Prompt.
14. If you find the Sword of Light before defeating Mishaela, the
    chapter ends when you defeat her, whether or not you have searched
    any other chests.
15. Hanzou hides in a bush in Runefaust.  Look for a throwing star.

N) USELESS ITEMS

 1. A chest hidden in a wall of the Moon Stone Cave contains the
    Sugoi Mizugi (Awesome Swimsuit).  Give it to Tao and she will
    wear it.

 2. A chest hidden at a corner of the archers' butte near Pao Bridge
    contains the Kitsui Fuku (Daring Dress).  Give it to Anri and
    she will wear it.

 3. A chest hidden in an alley outside Balbazak's Fortress contains
    the Kenji (Public Prosecutor), who has no known use.

 4. A chest hidden in the port bow of the ship on the second voyage
    contains the Teppo (Gun), which has no known use.

 5. There are said to be a pair of sunglasses and a Kakuchan (papa
    doll) hidden somewhere on battlefields.

O) CHEATS

1. Name all characters.  Start a new game and go to the "Name Your
Character" screen.  Press and hold Start, A, B, and C on controller 2
