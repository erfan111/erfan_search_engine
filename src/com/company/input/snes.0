SNES Documentation v2.17: Written by Yoshi of Digital Exodus.
****************************************************************************
        Well well well... Looks like you've decided to go into the
        SNES programming world? Well, be prepared for lots of learning,
        and a TON of questions...

        First off, I recommend you have atleast a *LITTLE* experience
        in 65c816 assembly, or 65c02 assembly (6502 counts too). 80x86
        doesn't count; 680x0 might, but it's a little different...

        This document covers more than any other public domain document
        which i've seen: No, i'm not bragging, i'm stating a fact. Even
        thou, any information which you wish to add to this document be
        sure to send to me! How? Read on (all about me! :-) ).
****************************************************************************
        I'm 17 years old; brown/blonde hair, blue/grey eyes. 5 foot
        10 inches (175cm) tall, 145 pounds (62.25kg). I am currently
        attending Corvallis High School in Corvallis, Oregon. I'm a
        Senior, and will be next year too (I do not graduate in 1994
        like everyone else; failed too many classes). I work at Oregon
        State University as a Computer Science apprentice/administrator
        for Computer Science Outreach Services.
	I'm pay-jobless, meaning my current job is volunteer work. I'm
	VERY available for hire. :-)

        In my spare time, I enjoy writing SNES documentation (HA HA),
        programming, sleeping, drawing (freehand and via mouse),
        spending time on IRC (you can *ALWAYS* find me here, just
        about ANY time of the day too), and just being myself; oh ya,
        work and school too! :-)

Thanx to ALL of those who've helped me make this SNES Document as good as it
is now, and as better as I hope it can get:

	grind			tm2			_Norm
	Jehu		       ...all the people on famidev...

	    ...and all the rest of you: you know who you are...
