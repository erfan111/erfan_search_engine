During the game, type 'aerf' for ultra-fast acceleration and slow-down.

average time. Type 'bgasst' to go to the gas station with real time.
And I beleive I'm the first person to figure this one out,
on the second level where the sign says 'Play grand prix circuit'
type ',bruce' and watch it change to 'Bruce Dawson wrote this!'
There is another cheat ('6outran') but I don't know what it is for.
