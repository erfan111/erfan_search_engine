Notes:
------
- If you're converting Tempest to run in a cabinet with a horizontal
  monitor, you can get the game to display correctly by switching the
  X-OUT and Y-OUT pins, and/or grounding the X-INVERT and Y-INVERT pins.
- Once you've got the game displayed correctly, you can then fiddle with
  the XSIZE and YSIZE pots on the main board to resize the picture until
  you get something you like.
- This doesn't work on all monitors, so your mileage may vary, not only
  from monitor to monitor, but from board set to board set.  Tempest can
  be very finicky about which hardware it'll co-operate with.
