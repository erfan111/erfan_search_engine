500 years ago, Shang Tsung was banished to the Earth Realm.  With the 
aid of Goro he was to unbalance the furies and doom the planet to a 
chaotic existence.

By seizing control of the Shaolin Tournament he tried to tip the scales 
of order towards chaos.  Only seven warriors survived the battles and 
Shang Tsung's scheme would come to a violent end at the hands of Liu 
Kang.

Facing execution for his failure and the apparent death of Goro, Tsung 
convinces Shao Kahn to grant him a second chance.

Shang Tsung's new plan is to lure his enemies to compete in the Outworld 
where they will meet certain death by Shao Kahn himself.

Now the Kombat Kontinues...

Welcome to the 21st, and perhaps final, revision of the FAQ.  This guide 
has been compiled over the last year by the players on the net and 
myself.  ALL moves and fatalities listed are confirmed.  This guide is 
for arcade versions 3.1 and up.  Older machines do not include some of 
the moves and many of the fatalities.  If you find yourself playing on 
an outdated machine, have the owner contact Midway for the replacement 
chips.

If you have any additions send mail directly to me and I will include it 
in the next guide, if there is ever need for one.  Information posted to 
alt.games.mk and rec.games.video.arcade will also be incorporated into 
this guide.  Credit will be given to those who contribute.  An attempt 
will be made to have this posted to both of the newsgroups every once in 
a while.  There are a few other ways of obtaining the latest revision of 
the FAQ and obtaining other MK information:

===================
GENERAL DEFINITIONS
===================

While reading through the moves, the + can be substituted by and, and 
the - can be substituted by then.  For example, 'two forward - HIGH 
PUNCH' should be read as 'press the joystick twice towards the opponent 
then press HIGH PUNCH'.  Another example, 'LOW PUNCH + BLOCK' should be 
read as 'press LOW PUNCH and BLOCK at the same time'.  Button names are 
listed in all caps.

Quarter-Circle Towards:  Rotate joystick from the down position to the 
forward position then press the button indicated.  (actual movement is 
down - down to forward - BUTTON)

Quarter-Circle Away:  Rotate joystick from the down position to the away 
position then press the button indicated.  (actual movement is down - 
down to away - BUTTON)

Half-Circle Towards:  Rotate joystick from the away/down position to the 
forward/down position then press the button indicated.  (actual movement 
is away/down - away/down to forward/down - BUTTON)

Half-Circle Away:  Rotate joystick from the forward/down position to the 
away/down position then press the button indicated.  (actual movement is 
forward/down - forward/down to away/down - BUTTON)

hold then release:  Press and hold the button while your character 
charges.  When finished charging release the button.  Other actions may 
be performed while charging, which is a good way of keeping the move a 
surprise.  You can also charge a move before a round begins.  If you are 
hit by the opponent the charge will still remain intact.  With the 
exception of Mileena, you must be standing on the ground in order for a 
charged move to work.

(hold BLOCK):  Block is only used in a move or fatality to stabilize 
your fighter, to keep them from jumping or walking.  It is a good idea 
to release BLOCK before pressing the required button.  You do not need 
to use BLOCK if you can be at the right distance for a fatality.

down - up:  The teleport can also be down by flicking the joystick down, 
making the joystick spring up and down.  This is applicable to Raiden 
and Kung Lao.

Pit/Spikes:  This is the fatality where you knock the victim into the 
pit or onto the spikes, either on The Pit II or Kombat Tomb stages.

Babality/Friendship:  Babalities are moves where instead of finishing 
your opponent you can turn them into a baby.  Friendships are similar, 
only you make friends with your opponent.  In order to do a babality or 
friendship, you can not use either punch button on the winning round.

	o	Random select may be done by pressing up and start from the 
Choose Your Fighter screen.  Be sure to have the selector positioned 
where it originally appears.

	o	To turn throws off in a two player match, hold down and HIGH 
PUNCH on both joysticks after you select your fighters.  A message will 
appear saying throws are disabled.

	o	On the Dead Pool stage you may knock the victim into the 
pool, where they go under the slime and come up a skeleton.  All the 
Dead Pool fatalities are performed by holding LOW PUNCH and LOW KICK 
while doing the standard uppercut.

	o	During attract mode, pull down on either joystick to bring 
up the top 15 players.

==========================
FRIENDSHIPS AND BABALITIES
==========================

Instead of finishing your opponent, you have the option to violate the 
spirit of Mortal Kombat and be compassionate.  You may either turn them 
into a baby or make friends with them.  This is a good way to show 
others what a nice game Mortal Kombat II is.

In order to utilize a friendship or babality, you may not press either 
punch button during the winning round.  This would include all normal 
punching moves, as well as all missile weapons involving a punch button 
and a few of Shang Tsung's morphs.  Friendships and babalities may be 
done from any distance on the screen.  Every fighter has a fairly good 
arsenal without the punch buttons, although this is much harder to 
accomplish against a human opponent.  The easiest way to win against the 
computer without the punch buttons is with a jump-kick pattern.

Face Punch:  Rapid punches to the head takes off good damage, and pushes 
the opponent away if they are standing and blocking.  Use after a 
blocked kick or blocked missile at close range.  The opponent will not 
have time to recover and you can start punching.  Don't stop until they 
are pushed out of your punching range.

Body Punch:  Good for punching a crouching or ducking opponent, or as 
retaliation for a close blocked move.  This takes off good damage if 
unblocked, and also pushes the opponent back.  If you successfuly hit 
your opponent with a few body punches, quickly move up to the face 
punches to take off more damage.

Standing Kick:  Useful after blocking a missile weapon or sweep at close 
range.  Also good for hitting opponents jumping towards you.  Be sure to 
kick them as close to their feet as possible.  The will ensure that you 
override their jump kick.  The standing kick is also good to use after 
sweeping your opponent.  Be sure to be standing at the fullest extent of 
your kick though, it is easy to retaliate against.

Uppercut:  The uppercut takes off the most damage of any standard move.  
Best used as retaliation:  after a blocked kick, missile, or other move 
at close range.  It is also very effective for hitting jumping 
opponents.  Liu Kang, Johnny Cage, Kitana, and Mileena have the best 
uppercuts in the game.  Baraka, Jax, Kung Lao, Shang Tsung, and Raiden 
have good uppercuts.  Sub-Zero, Scorpion, and Reptile have weak 
uppercuts.  The difference between a good and bad uppercut is range and 
hitting area; they all take off the same amount of damage, like all 
other moves.

Crouch Punch:  Useful for pushing away opponents at close range.  The 
opponent recovers quickly and it takes off very little damage, but hard 
to retaliate against.  Also used to juggle opponents in a corner combo.

Crouch Kick:  Much slower than the other ducking kick.  This move hits 
the opponent higher and takes off more damage, but can almost always be 
retaliated against.  Best used to hit jumping in opponents.

Low Kick:  This quick kick is useful for keeping opponents away while 
close fighting.  Can be done multiple times very rapidly to keep them at 
bay.  Takes off very little damage and is hard to retaliate against.

Roundhouse:  Probably not the technical name for this move but that is 
what it will be called.  Good for hitting jumping opponents, and also 
useful at close range fighting.  If hit, the opponent is sent flying an 
unnatural distance.

Sweep:  One of the most powerful moves in the game.  This keeps 
opponents away from you like no other move can.  Best used at its full 
extent, otherwise it is a bit easier to retaliate against.

Specialty:  The forearm, elbow, headbutt, etc.  These moves stun the 
opponent momentarily but take off little damage.  Easy to block and 
retaliate against.  These are more of an 'insult' move, but can be very 
effective if you mix it in while close fighting.

Throw/Flip:  Another powerful move that can counter a defensive player.  
Takes off good damage, but is easily blocked by using BLOCK + down + 
away.  Good to use when jumping in, especially behind the opponent, and 
during close fighting when they make a move.

Knee:  The knee can only be used up close.  It takes off little damage 
and is easy to retaliate to if blocked, unless you are playing Baraka, 
who has a knee - kick move.  Good to use while close fighting when you 
anticipate your opponent about to sweep, punch, etc.

Air Jab:  To punch your opponent out of the air, you must time your 
punch so that you hit them as close to their foot as possible.  You can 
use either punch button, but HIGH PUNCH is easiest.  Using LOW PUNCH is 
good for jabbing them up multiple times.

Heavy Punch:  This move is a regular punch, but takes off uppercut 
damage.  The easiest way to do this is to do the air jab, except punch 
early.  Try to time it so that their foot hits your punch just as you 
are bringing your arm back in.  This can also happen during close 
fighting when you are punching your opponent.  This is not a 'legit' 
move, more like a computer glitch that tricks it into taking away more 
health.

Jump Kick:  Jump and HIGH KICK or LOW KICK the opponent.  This is one of 
the most powerful moves in the game, especially against the computer.  
The hitting area of the jump kick varies from fighter to fighter.  The 
best kickers are Baraka and Shang Tsung.  When fighting the computer, 
the best time to kick is early.  Most often the computer will keep 
walking towards you and get hit.  When fighting a human, the best time 
to kick is late.  This will ensure an accurate hit that is harder to 
retaliate against.  The focal point of the jump kick is the foot, so try 
to place your foot as close to your target as possible.  The lower the 
jump kick, the easier the combo.

Jump Punch:  Jump and HIGH PUNCH or LOW PUNCH the opponent.  This is 
pretty much the same as the jump kick but takes off less damage and 
leaves you more vulnerable.  It also does not knock the opponent down.

Hop Kick:  Jump and kick the opponent on your way up.  This can be used 
to counter a jumping opponent, or as part of a combo.  Also good for 
kicking a standing opponent in the face.

Hop Punch:  Jump and punch the opponent on your way up.  This is pretty 
much the same as the hop kick but takes off less damage and leaves you 
more vulnerable.  Heard this before?

Turn Around Kick:  Jump over your opponent and kick them after you turn 
around, but before you hit the ground.  Harder to retaliate against than 
a normal jump kick, and makes some combos easier.

To block against an attack:  BLOCK or down or down + BLOCK 
To block against the throw:  down + back or down + back + BLOCK

========
LIU KANG
========

Uppercut:  Awesome
Jump Kick:  Weak
Roundhouse:  Good

Liu Kang has some great weapons in his arsenal.  He is a good offensive 
fighter, and if played right, can be a good defensive fighter too.  The 
Low Fireballs are good for keeping people on their toes, and is great at 
close range, because it is hard to retaliate against.  The High Fireball 
can be done in the air, which is good for combos and shooting down 
jumping opponents.  His Flying Kick and Bicycle Kick are easily 
blockable, but good for combos and retaliation.  The Bicycle Kick takes 
off heavy damage.  Liu Kang has a good roundhouse, which is great for 
knocking people out of the air.  He is also inheritently good.

========
KUNG LAO
========

Uppercut:  Good
Jump Kick:  Weak
Roundhouse:  Good

This guy is cool.  Not only does he look cool, he is a good fighter.  
His Hat Throw is steerable, which is good for hitting ducking or jumping 
opponents.  It comes out fairly slow though, keep that in mind.  While 
doing the Whirlwind Spin, he can not be hit by anything other than a 
missile weapon or the Ground Dmash.  It takes a while to fire up, and 
there is a period where the Spin speeds up and slows down, in which you 
are vulnerable to regular hits.  You must either kick or punch after you 
do the teleport, otherwise you are likely to get hit.  The Aerial Kick 
is a good suprise weapon.  Don't abuse it though, or you will get 
abused.  Try jumping away from your opponent then doing it.  Use it 
sparingly and when least expected.

===========
JOHNNY CAGE
===========

Uppercut:  Awesome
Jump Kick:  Good
Roundhouse:  Good

Cage is a great close in fighter.  He has excellent low jabs, good for 
punching crouching opponents.  Combine that with the Ball Breaker and 
the Shadow Kick and he is powerful.  The Shadow Kick is best used as 
part of a combo, or for hitting an unsuspecting opponent.  Every once in 
a while the Shadow Kick will be red, and make a crackling sound.  This a 
random occurence and does nothing special.  The Shadow Uppercut is good 
for hitting jumping opponents and using with combos.  Be careful, 
though, it will leave you handing in the air if you miss.  The Fireballs 
are good at long range.  Mix the high and low to keep your opponent 
guessing.  The High Fireball can be used to hit jumping opponents.  The 
Ball Breaker.  Everyones favorite.  Very good against male opponents.  
It has suprising range and takes off great damage, but if blocked, is 
easy to retaliate against.

=======
REPTILE
=======

Uppercut:  Weak
Jump Kick:  Good
Roundhouse:  Awesome

Reptile is a finesse fighter.  You have to know how to play him to be 
effective with him.  His Acid Spit takes off little damage but can come 
out very fast and often.  It comes out high, which is good against 
jumpers.  The Forceball comes out painfully slow.  If the opponent gets 
hit with the Foreceball, they will get knocked into the air towards you, 
where you can combo them.  An effective move is to do the Foreceball 
then fire the acid after it.  The Slide is still a great move, good for 
close range fighting and at the end of a combo.  Invisibility is his 
greatest asset, just as long as you keep your opponent guessing as to 
where you are.  Once your are hit, even if it is a blocking hit, the 
invisibilty wears off.  You can reappear by doing the invisibilty move 
again.

========
SUB-ZERO
========

Uppercut:  Weak
Jump Kick:  Good
Roundhouse:  Awesome

Sub-Zero is another fighter who lacks high power offense.  His Iceball 
is easily blockable.  The Ground Freeze is easily avoidable.  You must 
bait your opponent into jumping towards you then get them, either with 
the roundhouse or the Ground Freeze.  If you do hit your opponent, 
always do the Ground Freeze underneath them.  They will have to jump 
away in order to avoid slipping on the ice.  Sub-Zero is a good close 
range fighter, with good low jabs.  The Slide is still a great move, 
good for close range fighting and at the end of a combo.  Copy and paste 
rule.

===========
SHANG TSUNG
===========

Uppercut:  Good
Jump Kick:  Awesome
Roundhouse:  Weak

The only special move Shang Tsung has is the Fireballs.  These take off 
good damage if they hit, and can be sent out three at a time.  When you 
morph into another fighter, you stay morphed for about 15 seconds, at 
which point you moprh back into Shang Tsung.  During the morphing stage 
you are vulnerable to all hits.  His other weapon is his jump kick.  It 
has awesome range and hitting area, as well as being very accurate.

======
KITANA
======

Uppercut:  Awesome
Jump Kick:  Good
Roundhouse:  Weak

Kitana has the most devastating move in the entire game:  the Fan Lift.  
If you trap an opponent in this, you can take off at least half of their 
energy.  The trick is getting your opponent to jump into it, which takes 
some skill.  The Aerial Punch is good for hitting jumping opponents and 
as part of combos.  The Fan Throw comes out slowly while done on its on, 
but as part of a combo, it comes out lightning quick.  The Fan Throw 
takes off average damage.  Kitana is fast all around and good at close 
fighting, with her speedy jabs and kicks.  Throw in the Fan Swipe, good 
for close fighting, and you have on the best fighters in the game.

===
JAX
===

Uppercut:  Good
Jump Kick:  Good
Roundhouse:  Weak

Jax has some very powerful moves, and is a terrific close in fighter.  
The Quadruple Slam can be done every time you throw your opponent.  Just 
throw them the regular way and tap HIGH PUNCH until the fourth slam is 
over.  The Gotcha Grab can catch unsuspecting and jumping opponents and 
subject them to facial assault.  Up to five face smashes are possible, 
just keep hitting LOW PUNCH.  The Back Breaker is best used as a combo.  
You can follow must jump kicks or hop kicks with this for additional 
damage.  The energy wave takes off average damage, but has a very long 
hitting area, which is great for hitting jumpers.  Add the Ground Smash 
to every hit you do for extra damage.  The only way to block this is to 
jump.

=======
MILEENA
=======

Uppercut:  Awesome
Jump Kick:  Good
Roundhouse:  Weak

Mileena is very effective when playing a controled offense.  The 
Teleport Kick can be used to knock all jumping opponents to the ground, 
and to hit opponents right after they fire their missile weapon.  It is 
easy to spot and block, though.  Her Sai Throw is a charge weapon which 
makes it more awkward to use.  But once it is mastered, you can throw it 
into most combos.  It can be used in the air to hit jumping opponents.  
The Ground Roll is the key element to most of her combos.  Best used 
after a jump kick, because if blocked, you are vulnerable to nasty 
things.

======
BARAKA
======

Uppercut:  Good
Jump Kick:  Awesome
Roundhouse:  Good

One of the best close in fighters.  The Blue Bolt is an average missile 
weapon that does average damage.  Baraka is very vulnerable after he 
shoots it.  He can easily be swept from long range, and his arms stick 
way out, just waiting to be hit.  The Blade Fury, the bloodiest move in 
the game, is good to use for inbound jumping opponents, or as part of a 
jump kick combo.  It is hard to use at close range, because the motion 
requires three back taps, which move you away from your opponent.  The 
Blade Swipe has long range, about the same as the sweep.  The Double 
Kick may look funny, but it is devastating if used properly.  At close 
range it is unblockable if used twice in a row.  That, combined with the 
swipe, roundhouse, awesome jabs, and good roundhouse, make Baraka one 
tough fighter.  Another assett is his jump kick, which has a huge 
hitting area.  This makes it almost impossible to defend against his 
jump kicks.

========
SCORPION
========

Uppercut:  Weak
Jump Kick:  Good
Roundhouse:  Awesome

Scorpion can be used both defensively and offensively.  His roundhouse 
makes him almost impossible to jump at.  The Spear can be used to pull 
in jumping opponents, and is also good as part of a combo.  Always 
follow the Spear with an uppercut, unless you are feeling cocky.  Your 
opponent will be stunned after they are speared, but do not try to jump 
over them, they will suddenly revive.  The Air Throw is hard to pull off 
against a decent human opponent.  It is effective not at the top of 
Scorpions jump, but closer to the ground, where it is harder to react 
to.  The Teleport Punch is good to keep people guessing when standing on 
the far side of the screen.  Never use the teleport at an obvious time, 
it is easy to retaliate to.

======
RAIDEN
======

Uppercut:  Good
Jump Kick:  Weak
Roundhouse:  Good

And finally Raiden, the thunder god who turned into a good guy.  He is a 
tremendous offensive player is used right.  The Teleport can get you 
around and out of trouble quickly, and is good for sneaking close to 
your opponent.  The Body Launch can be done in the air, which is good 
for catching jumpers, or picking them off the ground by just touching 
their head.  The Lightning is an average missile weapon, doing average 
damage.  The Electric Grab is a charge move, which restricts your use of 
the HIGH PUNCH button and ties up your hands.  Not very effective unless 
you are good at keeping it a suprise.  Always do a combo after the 
Electric Grab shocks your opponent.  This move does not work against the 
computer for some reason.



************************************************************************
*********************     Strategy and Tactics     *********************
************************************************************************

Here are some basic things you can do while fighting the computer or a 
human opponent.  Let me emphasize basic.  You experts allready know all 
this stuff.  The following are just some suggestions that you can apply 
if you are a novice or just learning the game.  Not all the known 
tactics are included for the sake of space and my sanity.  Go to your 
arcade and watch a few pros to see what to do in different situations.  
Around here, I've noticed that different areas of town have different 
tactics that are used.  Once you get used to playing a different style, 
you can use that knowledge to your advantage.

===========================
FIGHTING COMPUTER OPPONENTS
===========================

The computer is very easy to defeat once you get used to the patterns it 
uses.  To counter this ease of defeat, the computer behaves cheaply:  it 
can throw you at all times, and do missile weapons faster than possible.  
The inability to block computer throws forces you into a pattern of jump 
kick combos.  Why can't you block computer throws?  Perhaps to force you 
into more offensive attacks.

	o	Use sweeps a lot, and sweep multiple times.  Time them so 
they hit the feet of the opponent at your fullest range.  Otherwise the 
computer will walk through your sweep and throw you.  It is possible to 
beat the computer using nothing but sweeps.

	o	Use early jump kicks a lot.  Jump away from your opponent as 
far a you can.  Then jump towards them and kick early.  The computer 
will either walk right into your kick, jump back, or try to retaliate.  
Most often as retaliation they will do a straight up jump kick that will 
usually not connect.

	o	Time your jump kicks.  If you are far away from the 
computer, stand still.  The opponent will walk halfway across the screen 
then stop.  It will then start to fire a missile weapon.  At this point 
walk forward a bit then jump towards them.  Their missile attack should 
go under you, leaving them vulnerable to a jump kick then combo.  If you 
jump too soon or too late you will get hit.

	o	Avoid all close in fighting.  Don't try to walk up and punch 
the computer unless on a low difficuly setting.  They will either throw 
you or punch you then throw you.  Only punch the computer as 
retaliation.

	o	Walk the computer to the corner.  Sometimes when you jump 
towards the computer oppoenent, they will start to walk backwards.  Keep 
walking towards them until they reach the corner.  When they do, walk 
back to a good jump kick range.  Wait for the computer to start to fire 
their missile, then jump in and do the combo of your choice.

	o	If you jump in and the computer blocks, walk back a few 
steps then jump away.  If you jump back immediately, the computer will 
hit you with a missile or a straight up hop kick.

	o	Using which joystick determines some computer actions.  
Playing on the right side usually makes it easier to defeat the 
computer.  Playing on the left side allows you to trick the computer 
into jumping towards you.  Let the computer walk towards you.  When they 
are getting within sweep range, jump away.  Sometimes the computer will 
stand there for a moment then jump towards you without kicking, leaving 
them vulnerable to the combo of your choice.  Of course playing on the 
left side makes the computer more difficult, somehow.

	o	If you are fighting the first opponent on medium or less 
difficulty, you can just use the crouching punch the entire round and 
the will not be able to throw you.

================
FIGHTING KINTARO
================

Kintaro is actually a challenge to beat.  His moves are very powerful 
and he is fast for a big guy.  Stay away from that scorching fireball 
blast and you should be OK.  Don't let the crowd get to you either, they 
are definately biased.

	o	Use footsweeps a lot, he is a sucker for them.  Time your 
sweep so that you hit him with the end of your foot just as he walks 
into range.  He will stagger back and groan.  Duck, then repeat.

	o	Jump kicks work sometimes, but don't use them a whole lot.  
Kintaro will most likely block then grab you or punch you.  If he does 
block, you can try to jump away and run the risk of the fireballs.  Or 
try a standing block.  If he punches or uppercuts you, it hurts, but at 
least you won't go flying.  Hop kicks work the same way.

	o	Kintaro is a cocky four armed tony the tiger.  If he leans 
back, growls, and flexes, uppercut him.  Missile him.  Jump kick and 
combo him.   Hurt him.

	o	Kintaro is easiest to hurt when he hops towards you.  It is 
easy to spot when he will do it because he hops in place first.  If you 
see him do this, align yourself to be in the best position to retaliate.  
When he hops towards you, uppercut him or whatever.

	o	If Kintaro spits fireballs at you, duck.

	o	When Kintaro jumps into the sky, get out of the way.  The 
best things to do is jump away and kick.  This will usually hit.  If you 
are good, you can uppercut Kintaro as he is coming down.  If you are 
trapped in the corner, try jumping away from the corner while punching.

	o	Always do your missile after you knock Kintaro down.  It 
will usually hit him unless you are on the far side of the screen.

	o	After Kintaro jumps on you from the sky, he will always lean 
back and growl.  When he does this you can either walk up and uppercut 
him, use your missile, or use a jump kick - combo.

==================
FIGHTING SHAO KAHN
==================

Shao Kahn, like Kintaro, is a challenge to beat.  You can not fight him 
'normally' because he is immune to jump kicks, walks faster than you, 
and has devastating moves.  Stay away from his spear, and never get hit 
by his shadow charge.

	o	When the round begins, chances are Shao Kahn will charge you 
or throw his spear at you.  If this happens, jump away from him quickly.  
If you can't jump in time, duck and block, then jump away.  You will be 
forced to take blocking damage, which hurts.

	o	Shao Kahn is a taunter.  If he says things like 'You will 
die' and 'I will destroy you', he is taunting you.  He is also 
vulnerable then.  Walk up and uppercut him, missile him, etc.

	o	One tactic to use is to jump right in front of Shao Kahn and 
immediately duck.  He will either charge you (in which case you take 
damage), or uppercut you.  His uppercut will miss and you will have a 
chance to uppercut him, or do whatever.  Repeat this throughout the 
round.

	o	If you do hit Shao Kahn, be sure to fire your missile while 
he is getting up.  He will always get hit if you are at the right 
distance.

	o	Another tactic is to go all the way into the corner.  Let 
Shao Kahn get close.  If he charges, block then uppercut.  Follow the 
uppercut with a missle.  Then duck and block again and hopefully he will 
do the same thing.

	o	The easiest way to beat Shao Kahn is to use Kitana.  Let 
Shao Kahn walk close to you then do the fan lift.  He will walk right 
into it.  Do the jump kick - fan throw - aerial punch combo.  Allow him 
to walk towards you again and repeat.  This tactic also works well on 
Kintaro.

========================
FIGHTING HUMAN OPPONENTS
========================

	o	Play defensively.  Always allow your opponent to make the 
first move.  When they do make a move, capitalize on their mistakes.  
Learn how to retaliate effectively to take off the most damage.

	o	Master close fighting.  If you can handle an opponent at 
close range, this will force them into jumping or long range attacks 
which you can counter.  Use a series of low punches, rounhouses, sweeps, 
crouching punches, and crouching kicks to throw them off balance.  Your 
opponent will always expect you to throw jabs at them, but when you mix 
in a crouching punch or a roundhouse, that will throw them off, and they 
will react hastily.  Learning how to block properly (down + away) is 
also very important.

	o	Never jump.  Especially towards your opponent.  Unless you 
are playing Baraka or Shang Tsung, it is very easy to retaliate against.  
Stay on the ground as much as possible.  Always walk towards your 
opponent and engage them in close fighting.

	o	Never use missile weapons at close to mid range.  It is too 
easy to retaliate against at close distance.  At mid distance, it is 
very easy to do a jump kick over the missile weapon.  Missle weapons at 
long distance is good of course, unless you are playing a Scorpion or a 
Mileena who can get you with a special move.

	o	Learn other tactics by watching or playing someone else.  
Learning by experience is the best way to go, and you can pick up 
different strategies that are not listed here.



************************************************************************
****************************     Combos     ****************************
************************************************************************

==============
GENERAL COMBOS
==============

Crouch Punch - Uppercut
Jump Kick - Sweep
Jump Kick - Standing Kick
Jump Kick - Hop Kick
Jump Kick - Missile Weapon
Air Jab - Hop Kick
Air Jab - Missile
Air Jab - Standing Kick

	o	Jump Kick - Sweep:  If you are fighting against the 
computer, you can usually follow a jump kick a foot sweep.  Sweep again 
until they jump away then start this again.  Against a human opponent, 
jump kick them near in the corner then do the sweep.

	o	Jump Kick - Standing Kick:  Jump kick your opponent low then 
do a regular standing kick, with HIGH KICK or LOW KICK.  You must press 
the kick button at the exact time when you land on the ground, otherwise 
the kick will come out to late.

	o	Jump Kick - Hop Kick:  Jump kick your opponent low and 
immediately do a hop kick.  This works well for some of the characters, 
including the ninjas and Shang Tsung.

	o	Jump Kick - Missile Weapon:  Jump kick your opponent low and 
immediately do the missile weapon.  It is important to kick them low and 
deep so you can land on the ground quickly and fire your missile weapon.  
Be sure to buffer the move right before you jump kick if possible.

	o	Air Jab - Hop Kick/Missile Weapon:  If your opponent jumps 
at you, high punch twice just as they are about to kick you.  This works 
best for good punchers or against weak kickers.  Follow the punches with 
a hop kick or a missile weapon.  If you punch more than twice, it is 
likely that you will not recover in time to get in another move.

=============
CORNER COMBOS
=============

Jump Kick - Roundhouse
Jump Kick - Missile
Jump Kick - Standing Kick
Jump Kick - Crouch Punch - Uppercut
Jump Kick - Two Crouch Punches - Uppercut
Jump Kick - Two Crouch Punches - Jab - Roundhouse
Jump Kick - Two Crouch Punches - Jab - Missile

	o	Jump Kick - Missile:  This is far easier to do in the 
corner, because your opponent is right in front of you when you land.  
Your missile doesn't have to travel far to hit.  This is good for 
Barakas slicer, Cages shadow kick, Mileenas Roll, etc.

	o	Jump Kick - Two Crouch Punches - Uppercut:  This works best 
for the male ninjas and Cage.  With the other fighters, just one crouch 
punch will suffice.  Jump kick your opponent low, immediately duck, and 
do two crouching punches.  This will juggle them higher where you can 
then do the combo of your choice.

	o	Other Corner Combos:  I am not going to bother to list these 
for each fighter because there are too many.  Especially with Kitana.  
The general corner combo rule is three hits and you're out.  After three 
consecutive hits, you will get stunned and pushed out of the corner.  
But if you can do the move fast enough, you can sometimes get more hits 
in.  Try experimenting with Kitana fan lift in the corner, using 
different series of hop kicks, punches, fan lifts, and fan throws.  One 
hundred percent damage combos are possible, you will discover.

========
LIU KANG
========

Jump Kick - Flying Kick
Jump Kick - Low Fireball
Jump Kick - Bicycle Kick
Jump Kick - Standard Fireball
Jump Kick - Standard Fireball - Low Fireball
Jump Kick - Standard Fireball - Bicycle Kick
Hop Punch - Low Fireball
Hop Punch - Standard Fireball - Low Fireball
Air Jab - Flying Kick
Air Jab - Fireball
Air Jab - Bicycle Kick - Low Fireball
Air Jab - Hop Punch - Standard Fireball

	o	Jump Kick - Flying Kick:  Jump kick your opponent low and 
immediately do the flying kick.  Start the two forward motion right 
before you hit, then quickly press HIGH KICK.  Sometimes if you do the 
flying kick to fast you will go over your opponent, so make sure you are 
on the ground first.

	o	Hop Punch - Standard Fireball:  Hop punch your opponent in 
the air and immediately do the standard fireball.  Start the two forward 
motion right before you hit, then quickly press HIGH PUNCH.  Follow this 
with a low fireball, which they must take blocking damage against.

	o	Jump Kick - Bicycle Kick:  Jump kick your opponent low and 
immediately do the bicycle kick.  Be sure to charge the bicycle kick a 
few seconds before you jump.  Wait until you land on the ground before 
releasing LOW KICK, otherwise the bicycle kick will not work.

	o	Jump Kick - Standard Fireball - Low Fireball:  Jump kick 
your opponent and immediately do a high fireball.  Start the two forward 
motion right before you hit, then quickly press HIGH PUNCH.  Follow the 
standard fireball with a ground fireball, which can usually be blocked.

	o	Air Jab - Bicycle Kick - Low Fireball:  Hit your opponent 
with several high jabs if they jump at you, then do the bicycle kick.  
If you hit them right, the bicycle kick will hit them near their feet,

immediately do the hat throw.  Be sure to guide the hat down so it hits 
the falling opponent.

hop kick quickly followed by the aerial kick.  This is a very fast combo 
that takes off good damage.

	o	Jump Kick - Whirlwind Spin:  Jump kick your opponent in the 
corner and execute the spin.  Be sure to kick them low, and start the 
spin immediately by pressing up and LOW KICK repeatedly.

	o	Whirlwind Spin - Jump Kick:  If the opponent is hit with the 
spin as it is slowing down, Kung Lao recovers fast enough for him to do 
a jump kick, aerial kick, or hat throw.

	o	Jump Kick - Sweep - Whirlwind Spin - Aerial Kick:  This 
combo work well against computer opponents who 'extend' on a missile 
weapon, such as Scorpion or Baraka.  Jump kick low and deep then walk 
forward a step or two.  Sweep, and as the opponent stands, do the 
whirlwind spin.  After this hits the opponent, jump forward and do the 
aerial kick.  Also - if you kick low and deep enough there is no need to 
walk forward, and sometimes it is possible to get in a hop kick after 
the whirlwind spin.

	o	Air Jab - Teleport - Aerial Kick:  Punch your opponent as 
they jump at you with a couple of high jabs.  Do the teleport and kick 
or punch, which should knock them high enough to get in the aerial kick.

the shadow uppercut as fast as possible, otherwise it will be to late to 
connect.  This is easier when close to the corner.

immediately do the low green bolt.  After starting the jump kick, keep 
the joystick in the away position, so you can quickly do the half-circle

with the first one, there is a good chance that the other two will hit.  
Do the three skulls before your opponent jumps towards or away from you.  
This really isn't a combo but it looks cool.

	o	Jump Kick - Flaming Skull:  Jump kick your opponent low and 
immediately do one flaming skull.  Start the two back motion right 
before you kick, then press HIGH PUNCH.  This one is hard as Shang 
Tsung's fireball travels slow.  Two fireballs after the jump kick is 
possible, and even three skulls is possible, although extremely 
difficult.

	o	Jump Kick - Slide:  Jump kick your opponent low and deep, 
then quickly morph into Reptile or Sub-Zero.  Once morphed, execute the

Shao Kahn.

fan throw.  As the are falling down do an uppercut.

************************************************************************

Congratulations!  You Have Found The Passage From The Outworld To The 
Earth Realm.  Now You Must Battle With An Undiscovered Warrior From 
Mortal Kombat One.  Prepare Yourself To Return To Goro's Lair.

This is the message you are greeted with when you meet the requirement 
to fight Jade or Smoke.  Jade is essentially Kitana, except that she is 
green and moves twice as fast.  She is immune to all missile weapons.  
Smoke is a gray male ninja who has the powers of Scorpion.  He moves 
extremely fast, and is constantly emitting smoke, which can be 
distracting.  Noob Saibot is an all black male ninja with the powers of 
Scorpion.  He is not as fast as Smoke, but still a challenge.

Both Jade and Smoke can be seen in the Living Forest when the look out 
from behind the middle trees.  They occasionally drop down during a 
match and give clues on how to reach them.  After you win or lose to any 
of the secret characters, you are returned to the Choose Your Fighter 
screen where you may pick another fighter.

Smoke clues:                       Jade clues:

I Am Called Smoke                  I Am Called Jade
Toasty                             Before The ?
You Can Start Finding Me           Ermac Who?
Ermac Who?                         I Will Meet You In Goro's Lair
You Can Not Defeat Me              Chun Who?
I Am One Of Three                  I Am One Of Three
Portal                             Restrict Yourself
I Will Meet You In Goro's Lair     Alone Is How You Will Find Me
Mortal Kombat One                  One Day We Will Fight!
Prove Yourself                     Bring On Kano And Sonya!

=============
TO REACH JADE
=============

	o	Win one round on the stage directly before the question mark 
using only LOW KICK.  That is the only requirement.  You may not press 
BLOCK.  You may reach Jade on any round of the stage.  Unnecessary 
requirements include flawless victories, fatalities, and a certain 
number of wins.

==============
TO REACH SMOKE
==============

	o	Be on The Portal stage playing a two player game.

	o	Wait until the face pops out in the lower right corner and 
says "Toasty!".  The face will appear when you uppercut your opponent, 
or your opponent uppercuts you.  There is no determined way to get the 
face to appear more frequently.  It can appear a few times during a 
match or not at all.

	o	As soon as the face appears, press the start button.  
Whoever presses their start button first will be the one who will fight 
Smoke.  After fighting Smoke, you are returned to the Choose Your 
FIghter screen where both players may pick again.

====================
TO REACH NOOB SAIBOT
====================

Incredible Winning Streak!  A New Warrior Awaits You.

	o	Win 50 games in a row.  You must be fighting against a human 
opponent and receive the gold MKII symbol.

If you lose to Noob Saibot, you may fight him again by winning just one 
more game or round.  Apparently the computer only has 49 wins tracked if 
you lose to Saibot, so you can theoreticly fight him over and over, as 
long as you lose to him.  And for the clueless, Noob Saibot is actually 
Boon Tobias backwards.  And for the truly clueless, Boon and Tobias are 
the creators of Mortal Kombat.



************************************************************************
*******************     Rumors and Things To Try     *******************
************************************************************************

==================
RUMORS KILLED DEAD
==================

	o	Kano is not a playable character in MKII.  The only place 
you will see Kano in MKII is in the background of the Kahn's Arena 
stage.  The Kano Transformations tally in the audits menu is nothing 
more than a red herring designed to generate interest and quarter 
pumping to find a secret that isn't there.  And it was effective.  An 
entire Usenet group is based on Kano sighting.

	o	'Alitys' that do not exist in MKII:  Animality, nudality, 
gunality, ageality, hookality, weirdality, nationality, brutality, 
rapality, gangstality, etc.  They never have and never will.

	o	Secret characters who you will not find:  Scarlett, Flame, 
Inferno, Kano, Goro, Sonya, Shawn, Ermac, Watchdog, the monster in the 
Dead Pool, that guy in the Living Forest, etc.  These characters do not 
exist in MKII.  They never have and never will.  The only secret 
characters in MKII are Jade, Smoke, and Noob Saibot.

	o	Stage fatalities that are unreal:  getting impaled on the 
hooks, getting knocked into the mouth of the trees, picking up the 
weapons in the weaponry and killing your opponent, raising the dead in 
the graveyard, etc.  These stage fatalities do not exist in MKII.  They 
never have and never will.

=============
THINGS TO TRY
=============

	o	Do Reptile's tongue fatality on The Armory stage and watch 
the floor.  This is a glitch and does not involve a secret room or 
character.

	o	Sub-Zero can do the first half of his freeze-uppercut 
fatality indefinitely.  When you defeat your opponent with Shang Tsung, 
morph into Sub-Zero and do the perma-freeze fatality repeatedly until 
you are changed back into Shang Tsung.  Then morph into the fighter of 
your choice and do the fatality on a frozen victim.

	o	Defeat your opponent on the Dead Pool stage near the corner.  
Then jump over them and do the Dead Pool fatality.  The victim will go 
flying the wrong way and splash into the wall.

	o	With Kitana, beat Shao Kahn by letting time expire.  When 
time is about to run out, catch Kahn in the fan lift so that he is off 
the ground when time runs out.  You will hear the sound of him 
exploding, and then the machine will freeze.  A good way to get your 
credits back after beating the game.  Of course, I am not endorsing 
this, just giving you the facts.  :)

	o	After doing the dead pool fatality, hold down on the 
joystick.  The computer will say "oh whoa" or something to that effect.

	o	Right after doing the pit fatality uppercut, hold down on 
both joysticks.  The body will slowly slip from the spikes and fall to 
the ground.

	o	Play 250 games in a row.  'You have reached the outer limits 
of the tournament.  Now you both must face a challenge from your 
past...'  Pong!  First player to seven wins.  It is just like the 
original Atari game.

*********************     Version Information     **********************
************************************************************************

To date there have been three major release versions of MKII: version 
1.1, 2.1, and 3.1.  With each release more and more things are added, a 
trend that will hopefully not be going on very much longer.  You can 
find out which version you are playing on by turning the machine off and 
back on again.  Remember, this guide is written for the most current

**  I would like to stress that all versions above 3.1 are not official 
versions and you will likely never see them.  I haven't seen them 
myself, so I can't confirm anything else that has been said about them.

                         (Animalities Are On There)

======================
LIU KANG (HO SUNG PAK)
======================

With his Shaolin temple in ruins, Liu Kang journeys into the Outworld, 
enters Shao Kahn's tournament and unleashes a fury that does not end 
until the defeat of Shao Kahn.  Liu Kang then returns to the seclusion 
of his Shaolin temple.  He pays his respects to his lost brothers and 
finally realizes that the events which have taken place were all 
fulfillment of his destiny.

=========================
KUNG LAO (ANTONY MARQUEZ)
=========================

A former Shaolin Monk alongside Liu Kang, Kung Lao also grieves the loss 
of their Shaolin brothers.  He realizes that his ultimate fate lies 
within the dark realm of the Outworld.  He defeats his Outworld 
opponents until he emerges the supreme champion.  With his strength and 
spirit in complete alignment he finally avenges the death of his great 
ancestor.  Although his greatest challenges lie ahead...

===========================
JOHNNY CAGE (DANIEL PESINA)
===========================

After disappearing from the set of his latest movie, Cage finally 
resurfaces.  He used all his knowledge and experiences as a fighter to 
end the Outworld menace.  Now heralded as a true hero, Cage receives the 
respect he rightfully deserves.  He also gets his inspiration for the 
sequel to his blockbuster movie Mortal Kombat.  MK II is released and 
quickly becomes the greatest motion picture event of all time.  Cage 
realizes that MK III is inevitable.

=======================
REPTILE (DANIEL PESINA)
=======================

Reptile has always loyally served as Shang Tsung's protector.  While 
maintaining a very low profile in the first tournament he discovered 
Tsung's plot to force the remaining members of his near extinct race 
into slavery under Shao Kahn's rule.  Reptile then devises a plan of his 
own.  He enters the Outworld tournament, defeats Shao Kahn and turns 
against Shang Tsung, ending his master's scheme.  Now his race can live 
on in their own peaceful existence.

========================
SUB-ZERO (DANIEL PESINA)
========================

When Sub-Zero failed to return from the Shaolin tournament and rumor of 
Shang Tsung's survival reached the Lin Kuei clan, they immediately sent 
another assassin to complete the task.  This new warrior is actually the 
younger brother of the original Sub-Zero.  He enters the outworld 
contest and accomplishes his task.  He learns of Scorpion's foul 
vendetta against his brother but will never know why his life was 
spared.  Perhaps a third tournament is in his future?

==============================
SHANG TSUNG (PHILLIP AHN M.D.)
==============================

Shang Tsung not only turns against and defeats both Kintaro and Shao 
Kahn, he also takes over their rule of the Outworld.  With Shao Kahn's 
armies at his command, he finally unbalances the Furies, and weakens the 
dimensional gates between the Outworld and the Earth Realm.  Along with 
his elite group of sorcerers he uses this weakness to march a never 
ending horde of demons into the earth and doom its inhabitants to 
eternal darkness.  Have a nice day.

=======================
KITANA (KATALIN ZAMIAR)
=======================

Through her years of working as an assassin, Kitana has learned many 
secrets, especially about her own past.  She finds that Mileena is not 
her twin but a grotesque clone created by Shang Tsung.  She learns that 
her parents were former rulers of the Outworld overthrown by Shao Kahn.  
Determined to take back what is rightfully hers she must defeat Kahn 
himself.  She does so by entering the tournament.  She retakes her 
parents' castle and restores the Outworld back into a realm of nobility.

==================
JAX (JOHN PARRISH)
==================

Jax finds Sonya held captive alongside their arch enemy Kano.  Her only 
chance of escape is by Jax entering Shao Kahn's contest.  With fierce 
determination he catches the Outworld warriors off guard and wins the 
tournament bringing Shao Kahn's rule to a crashing halt.  During the 
chaos that follows, Jax and Sonya escape through the dimensional gate 
from which they entered.  Kano once again eludes capture but Jax and 
Sonya know they will cross paths with him in the future.

========================
MILEENA (KATALIN ZAMIAR)
========================

Once thought to be Kitana's twin sister, Mileena is actually a grotesque 
clone created by Shang Tsung.  With Shao Kahn suspicious of Kitana's 
motives, Mileena seizes the opportunity to attack Kahn and his minions.  
Caught off guard they are no match for Mileena's speed.  She wins the 
tournament and together with her secret companion, Baraka, they rule the 
world as King and Queen.

========================
BARAKA (RICHARD DIVIZIO)
========================

Known for his unpredictable actions and wild fits of anger, Baraka goes 
on a rampage.  After defeating the earth warriors he attacks Shang 
Tsung, Kintaro and finally Shao Kahn himself.  After defeating Shao 
Kahn, Baraka's race of mutants arise from the wastelands and rebel 
against what is left of Kahn's army.  They eventually win and the 
Outworld comes under the rule of King Baraka.

========================
SCORPION (DANIEL PESINA)
========================

Upon learning of Sub-Zero's reappearance, Scorpion enters Shao Kahn's 
tournament.  He witnesses Sub-Zero spare the life of an opponent and 
realizes that this is not the same Sub-Zero who murdered him so long 
ago.  He lets the ninja live and goes on to defeat the Outworlders in 
their unholy contest.  With the defeat of Shao Kahn, Scorpion discovers 
a new purpose for his existence.  He becomes the guardian of the new 
Sub-Zero to atone for murdering his older brother and in preparation for 
a third tournament.

======================
RAIDEN (CARLOS PESINA)
======================

Familiar with Shang Tsung's lies and Shao Kahn's brutality, Raiden 
accepts their challenge to compete in an Outworld tournament.  He is 
well aware of their scheme to unbalance the Furies and invade the Earth 
Realm.  Raiden vows to use all his might to end their treachery.  
Winning the tournament Raiden destroys Shao Kahn and all his minions.  
He also destroys the dimensional gates which would have been their 
passageway to the Earth Realm.
