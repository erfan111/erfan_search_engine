Interview:

        "Interview" is a new column that will strive to get the most views on  the industry from as many "industry" people
as possible. Those interviewed will span from well known persons, to press relations managers, to even small-time
programmers.  
        For this issue's interview, I had seven game designers lined-up for interrogation. Some of them were well known
ones at that.  Unfortunately, acts of nature  can't be stopped. I lost my interviews along with the rest of the files that were
on my hard disk when my building was struck by lighting. Thanks to Chris Eisnaugle of Vor Technologies INC., who
promptly offered to do a second interview when he heard that my hard disk was destroyed, we are able to bring you
this new feature.  Chris started game design back in 1977. 

        Q: My first question was an easy one: " How did you get started in game design?"

         A: "I started with computers back in 1976 in High School. We had access to an HP-2000 which had a number
of text games on it (back then that's all we really had ). I got intrigued by a version of Star Trek (as a lot of people did).
From then on I had to know how it was written, so I taught myself basic and began writing various programs. I got
access to another system and found Adventure, I played it until I solved it one weekend. I then collected my notes and
set out writing it in basic for our HP. I had become hooked, and went on to write a number of other text games for that
HP. I think writing games is one of the most exciting and rewarding forms of programming you can do."

        Q:" What was your training background?"

           A: "No real formal training, although you do pick up tricks here and there. Back in 1971 I acquired one of the
first Apple II integer basic systems. I immediately set out to program some new and incredible games (since the Apple
had graphics). But I found there was a lot to learn. I taught myself 650[2 assembler, and learned every last piece of that
hardware. I  then experimented with various games (Asteroids Clone, Missile Command, Space Invaders, etc). From
these I learned tricks, shortcuts, and was able to really make the Apple do some pretty neat stuff. So most of my training
has been self taught with some tricks I  learned by talking to other programmers."

        Q: "Do you usually work alone, or with a group of people."

           A: "Back in 1978 to about 1983 I was primarily alone. That's how game were written back then.  You sat down
in a room and cranked out code etc. You did your own graphics, sound, and anything else.  From then on games
became much more complex and required artists, multiple programmers, etc. So now I work with a group of people as
projects have become so large. Most games today are like producing a mini-movie in a lot of ways."

        Q:  "How do you generate your ideas? Where do your ideas usually come from?"

           A: "Ideas are interesting, most of the really good ones (unique ones) will just hit you out of the blue. Others
come from watching the market to see what is popular, picking up on media events (Movies, etc). Some ideas, if there
are of a  role playing style, can come from books or magazines. With arcade style, I have found a lot come from just
watching everyday life and making a parody out of it. They really come from everywhere."

        Q: "What is the first step you take when you are designing games?"

        A: "Designing a game these days is pretty complex. Depending on the game, you need a story line, a cast, a
setting, etc. Role-playing games tend to try to emulate the world, therefore you need to take into account a lot of things
ahead of time. Arcade style games are a little different. I usually have a story line, design out a goal, design the game
pieces, etc. and build upon those.

        Q: "Do you help in the programming of the game, like writing the code, or is your job just to design the game
on paper?" 

        A: Chris: "I usually end up doing a lot of the coding. But get involved heavily with the actual story line, concept
as well."

        Q: "What kind of equipment do you work with?"

        A: " IBM Compatible, VGA, Macs, etc."

        Q: "Are there market studies done before a game is produced? If so, how are they preformed?"
        
        A: "Speaking for myself, I don't do specific studies, I rely more on what trends are showing. This, I guess, is a
market study but it is done very informally. There are also a lot of ideas that will usually do well and they fall into
categories (RPG's, Simulations, simple games like Tetris). Arcade style games usually don't do as well on home
machines [I guess SFII is the exception! -Ed].  I'm sure some companies do serious studies, but I'm not sure of the form
they would take."
        
        Q: "On an average, how long does it take to produce a game, from it's inception to getting it on the market.?"
        
        A: "That's a hard question to answer because most estimations are way off.  Simple games may only take a
few months, while complex games like large role playing games can take up to or beyond 1-2 years. It's hard to measure
as it depends on the games complexity, feature set, etc." 
        
        Q:  "A lot of gamers would like to know the steps it takes to produce a game?"
        
        A: "That will vary on whether you are an independent developer, or if you already belong to a game company.
Independent developers usually have it tougher, as they need to produce a prototype to show a company (assuming
they aren't distributing it themselves). If it's liked they can usually go ahead with the knowledge that the game company
will take care of the packaging, marketing, handling, distributors, etc. Game company's themselves will of course handle
all this, but can begin working on ideas with the foreknowledge that they will be produced. There is a lot involved like
getting the concept, creating the story line, doing the coding, beta testing, cleaning up, creating the manuals, creating
the packaging, dealing with distributors, marketing the game in magazines, mass producing the disks.....There is a
tremendous effort put forth in getting a game to market."
        
        Q: "Do you think there is enough variety and quality in the electronic games produced today?"

        A: "I think ideas are almost endless, as your mind is wonderful in coming up with new original concepts. I do
feel in  today's market there are a lot of games with similar styles. This is not always bad, as games can play similar,
but offer a totally different environment to play. So yes, there is a lot of variety, but I do feel there could be more. We
do seem to get into some trends, and game fads. Quality, yes I feel that the quality of games today is exceptionally
good. Used to be you could write a program in basic, sell it and make a mint (back in the dark ages 78-80 or so). Today
you must really produce high quality software to have a huge hit."
        
        With those last words, the interview was ended. Thank you Chris at Vor Technologies INC. for taking the time
to be the first person interviewed in Zapp!! In next issue, we may be interviewing some production managers at Infocom
to ask them about their new project "Return To Zork!" So stay tuned to Zapp!!

The Post Office Continued......
and to put a little money aside for college. I love playing video games, especially RPGs, and devote a lot of time to it.
What makes me mad, though, is how outrageously high the prices of games are these days. I'll go out and buy a fifty
dollar game and poof! There goes a whole week's earnings. I get especially angry when the game is a total dud. I've
read that after the first production run of most games, the cost of the company producing the game is lower than $5!
How can companies be getting away with such outrageously high prices when they are paying next to nothing to
produce the product? Since your probably more knowledgeable about the industry than me, can you give me a little
insight on this subject?
        Thanks for your time, and I can't wait to see the next issue of Zapp!!

        [Guess what, Chad. At one time I felt the same way you do about the expenses of this hobby. Companies will
usually charge whatever the market will bear. It's called "The Law of Supply and Demand." When there is a big demand
for video games, the prices will be high. But when there is no longer as large a demand for the product, you'll see the
prices slashed tremendously. Look at the NES, for instance. The price of it was close to $200 when it was first released,
but now it's less than $60 in most stores. Companies will charge the highest price they think they can get. After all,
they're out to make a profit.
        You also have to take into account that ANY hobby is going to be expensive. Tennis is very costly. A good
racquet can cost in the rang of  $200 or more. Collecting stamps, bike riding, painting, and even gardening costs money.
How about golfing, with all the equipment expense and green's fees? Any hobby will burn a hole in your bank account.
But there are a lot of ways to get around the cost of the video gaming hobby. Rent or borrow the games, trade games
with a group of friends, and ask people's opinions of the game before you buy. Also, check-out the fanzine arena for
more opinions on games.
        Thanks you for your contributions to "Not! and Way!," but unfortunately, "Not! or Way!" will not be printed this
issue due to not enough room. Expect it next issue though! I Hope you like this issue -Ed]
