Revision History

v0.1 Initial Release - very disorganised and missing many things....

v0.2 Added title picture, special moves and rewrote many sections in the
     guide.

v0.3 Restructured format for Specific Character Strategy section, minor
     revisions here and there....  First version uploaded to Andy Eddy's
     video games FAQ archive at ftp.netcom.com and Dave Kirsch's fighting
     game archive at ftp.krl.caltech.edu
      
v1.0 Added ending for Nakoruru, credits/acknowledgement and minor 
     revisions here and there...  Also got most of the spelling mistakes 
     out of the guide (hopefully!)  Although there is still bits
     missing this is the first official version (hence v1.0) 

v2.0 Slight format revision (sectioned each character with borders in
     the specific character strategy part for easier viewing), updated
     some of the counters to other characters' special moves as they have
     been verified, a more comprehensive table of contents with
     sub-headings, and all special moves are now called by their proper
     names taken from the SS2 TAPFAQ or the SS2 Move List, added taunts 
     and background info on Nakoruru from SS2TAPFAQ.

v3.0 Ran the whole thing through the spell-checker again....  Minor
     updates on counters for Mizuki (swine curse, demon attacks, mass
     confusion) and Nicotine (Shikigamireifu-fire, spiral kick), Jubei
     (Suigetsutoh), and other little bits here and there.  Finally got
     all the special moves names right I think and all special moves
     counters for each character are listed in alphabetical order of the
     names of the special moves..

v4.0 Major format changes again for easier viewing (also got rid of quite
     a bit of repeated information.  Added two new sections for each
     character in Specific Character Strategies (Normal Move Counters,
     Human Challengers Patterns and Strategy) and also general section on
     tactics against human opponents (Nakoruru Against Human Opponents).
     Again minor updates here and there for the strategies (most notably
     on how to beat CPU Kuroko), special moves counters and combos.

v4.5 The guide is now splitted into four parts for easier viewing and
     also so that when I update something I don't need to post the entire
     guide again - only the relevant parts.  Specific Character Strategy
     (CPU Patterns/General) for all characters are re-written into point
     form for easier viewing.  Minor updates here and there.

=========================================================================

Nakoruru - the transition from SS1 to SS2:

1) Graphics:  Graphically Nakoruru looks more 'mature' than in SS1.  She
is almost completely redrawn, has grown a bit taller (now nearly as tall
as all the other fighters) and has a slightly altered fighting stance.
The victory poses are OK and I like the Cape Wrap the best.  Some of her 
attacks are altered (e.g. crouching B slash, air A, B slashes).  The
fighting portrait at the vs. screen is excellent but the portrait of the
alternative colour Nakoruru looks quite 'evil' (dark skin, purple
eyes....*shudder*)...

2) Game Play:  Delay triple plus....  Most of the special moves has taken
a turn for the worse (see the Special move listing section for my
whinings...)  And the new one also lags like hell.  As for normal attacks,
standing far B slash also comes out slower now and standing close AB slash
does not hit ground opponents twice anymore except when you use it on
Earthquake (and Earthquake must be standing.)

Looking on a slightly brighter side, Nakoruru has better damage for her
attacks now.  The AB slashes are quite powerful - especially the air AB
and also standing far AB slashes.  They can usually do up to 25% damage.
The B slashes' damage is also a bit higher and it ranges from 10 to 15%.

SS2's special moves recognition system is very different from that of SS1
(where special moves are harder to pull off).  In SS2 special moves seem
to come out left, right and centre - sometimes even when you don't want
it!  This is not good news for Nakoruru as her special moves usually place
her in very vulnerable positions.  To make sure that the right special
move comes out, do the move slower than usual, making sure that the
joystick move across all the contact points required for the move, and
then press the button with a very slight pause after you have completed
the joystick motion.  This is particularly important for execution of the
Power Special, Apefuchi Kamui Rymuse and to a lesser degree Amube Yatoro.

The Angel Faced Falcon Handler
	NAKORURU

"Something evil is coming now!"
"I must hurry up.  The world is being destroyed by evil power!"
"Power, speed, and beauty.  I have defeated you in every way."

This damsel of Diana often stands travels to the centre of her country's 
deep forest to commune with Nature.  Recently, the voice of Nature has not
been too positive.  Indeed, it has been silent.  "The very soul of Nature
has been stolen!" screams Nakoruru as she speeds on her journey to the 
Netherworld with her trusty falcon friend, Mamahaha.

Misc. Info: Nakoruru is one of the Ainu, Japan's indigenous/aboriginal
  people.  In 1788, the Ainu still dominated Hokkaido and had not been
  subdued.  Today, several thousand Ainu remain.  Her bird is a Falcon,
  not an Eagle.

Fighting Stage: NORTHERN COUNTRY -- SUMMER

==========================================================================

Special Moves listing and Their Uses

The moves are listed for a Nakoruru standing on the left-hand side facing
right.

A - Weak Slash, B - Medium Slash, AB - Strong Slash
C - Weak Kick,  D - Medium Kick,  CD - Strong Kick

Moves marked with a '!' sign requires a weapon.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Annu Mutsube                    | Slides along ground with sword extended,                  
				| attacking low for weapon damage.
 O-   / | + Slash               |
    O   O                     ! |
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

   Annu Mutsube works best as a 'reactional' counter strike move to
whatever your opponent does, and it plays a major part in winning using
Nakoruru.  Because of the huge lag time after the move Annu Mutsube is
not something you can use all day long like Ukyo's Zanzou Fumikomi Giri
(Spirit Slide).  It must be used intelligently.  Use it to retaliate any
missed/blocked normal or special moves and to go through projectiles
(refer to Specific Character Strategies section).

   In SS2 Annu Mutsube doesn't work as an air counter anymore since it
hits low only now and thus will not hit an air-borne opponent.  However,
due to the introduction of a delay for late air AB or CD attacks, Annu
Mutsube can still be used to counter air opponents if they do a late air
AB or CD attacks.  Utilise this delay and stay in the crouching position
when your opponent jumps in, and if they try to hit you with an AB (for
the air AB or CD attacks to hit you when you are crouched, they must do it
very late), go straight into an A Annu Mutsube and get them when they
land!  It works - but requires good timing though.  Or you can use Annu
Mutsube to escape if you're trapped in the corner and opponent jumps in.

   Another use for this move is in combos - see Combos section for more
details.  Also its huge lag time afterwards can actually be used to
trick your opponents to make mistakes (see Nakoruru Against Human
Opponents items (g)).  Also note that at extremely close range, Annu
Mutsube is a 2-hit move.

   WEAKNESS:  Annu Mutsube has a slight delay time before it starts
depends on the button you pressed (A Annu Mutsube has shorter start time
delay than AB Annu Mutsube).  And the programmers of SS2 decided to keep
the HUGE lag time she has after executing the move (while Ukyo's
equivalent has nearly no lag time at all and starts very quickly too...)
It also suffered a decrease in priority and can be thrown out of at the
start and be hit out of any time as long as your opponent can time it
right (either with ABs or annoying crouching C kicks).  Also A Annu
Mutsube is shorter than in SS1 which also doesn't help in your quest to
counter-strike your opponent to death....

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Leyla Mutsube                   | Slides along ground, then rises, with
				| sword extended, attacking medium to air
 | \   -O + Slash               | for weapon damage.
 O   O                        ! |
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

   It is obvious that this move is primarily designed as an air counter
move.  However it is not as easy to use as say Haohmaru's Kogetsuzan
because it travels forward as well as upwards.  To use this move, you
should first learn the range of her A, B, and AB Leyla Mutsube (how far
it reaches up and also forward) and then use the appropriate one
applicable to the situation.  Make sure that when you execute a Leyla
Mutsube, Nakoruru will meet the opponent in the air with the front part of
her (the knife) touching the opponent only.  You might think that using
Leyla Mutsube is too much trouble, but once when you get it right it is
very effective.  For example, if opponent jumps in but is outside of your
jumping-forward AB/B slash counter, then doing the Leyla Mutsube will
counter very nicely.  Also, if an opponent jumps away or jumps straight up
in front of you, then you can execute Leyla Mutsube to hit them.

   Leyla Mutsube can also be used as a counter strike move like Annu
Mutsube.  Leyla Mutsubes reach your opponent slightly faster than their
Annu Mutsube counterparts (i.e. A Leyla Mutsube reaches an opponent faster
than A Annu Mutsube) but it does not hit low.

   Leyla Mutsube can also be used to get out of corners.  Make sure you
only use AB and only when your opponent is very close to you.  But use
this sparingly....  Another use of this move is for comboing (see Combos
section).  Also note that at extremely close range, Leyla Mutsube is a
2-hit move on ground opponents.

   WEAKNESS:  As with Annu Mutsube, the move has a slight lag time before
it starts (which depends on which button you use) and a HUGE lag time after
you land from it.  Therefore you must make sure that Nakoruru starts rising
before your opponent lands.  Also, as with Annu Mutsube, it is not as
'invincible' as everyone thinks.  If your opponents' attack in the air
touches Nakoruru on the top behind the knife they have a good chance of
knocking you out of the move or trading with you.  Also you can be thrown
out of the move at the start quite easily.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Amube Yatoro                    | Sends Falcon out in a burning attack
				| for fire damage.

      O O O                     | 
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

   This falcon attack is very important against CPU.  This is because the
CPU, even at higher levels, will nearly always not jump to avoid Mamahaha
until it has flied forward, this move should be used as much as possible
against CPU to get them to jump forward (then you can hit them out of the
sky) or to take blocked damage.  The spacing for this to work is such
that you are at a distance away from your opponents such that your B
Amube Yatoro will just reach your opponent.  Then if they jump in after
the move you can counter them out of the air.

   Against CPU teleporting ninjas trio (Galford, Hanzo and Earthquake),
after you knock them down you can also execute a falcon attack that
reaches them just AFTER they get up.  They will usually try the teleport
move and hit you from above but as you have already recovered from the
stun time of the falcon attack you can block it and then retaliate.

   Amube Yatoro is, however, only moderately useful against human
opponents.  Good human opponents will automatically jumps forward when
they see Nakoruru turns to summon the falcon, so use it only to get one
tick of blocked damage when you are sure the falcon will hit (e.g. as your
opponent gets up, or while your opponent is reeling back from a previous
attack of yours etc), or when you are very far away (use AB Amube
Yatoro).

   It is possible to use this as an air counter but you need nearly
perfect spacing and timing for it to work.

   WEAKNESS:  Again its delay time lets Nakoruru down again.  Amube
Yatoro has delay at the start (while she turns around and then gestures
for Mamahaha to attack) and at the end (hmm, I never knew that putting one
arm down and go back into a fighting stance takes that long...).  The
attack path in which hawk travels is also the same with no variation and
it is very easy for opponents at medium to close range to roll under or
jump and then retaliate.  Also, the Falcon doesn't hit opponents more than
once if blocked anymore.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Mamahaha Flight                 | Falcon grabs character; control then
                                | switches to bird for around 5-6 seconds,
 |   / O- + C                   | after which, character falls back to 
 O O                            | ground.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

   Apart from being the move that you have to do before you can dive off
to attack with Yatoro Poku or Kamui Mutsube, getting on your falcon has
other uses.  Most importantly is that it might tempt your opponent to try
to jump attack you, then as soon as you see them jumping you can then get
them with Yatoro Poku or Kamui Mutsube off the hawk.  If your opponent
has an upper-cut special move (e.g. Haohmaru, Wan-Fu, Charlotte etc.),
as soon as you see them walking close under you and starting the move,
Yatoro Poku in forward direction off the falcon, this way your opponents'
uppercut move will miss and you will have time to retaliate after landing.

   Also, it is useful when you are ahead on energy, and time is nearly up
(say about 4 or 5 seconds left).  Then getting onto the falcon, moving it
up and away as much as possible and waiting for a time-out win or luring
them to attack you is also very useful.

   WEAKNESS:  Well, you eventually fall down from the hawk (and again,
there is a damned delay after landing....).  So if your opponent decide
not to do anything while you are on the hawk, better quickly move it as
far away from your opponent as possible or Yatoro Poku off the bird away
from your opponent as quickly as possible.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Yatoro Poku (While flying)      | Spins downward from Falcon, in direction
				| corresponding to joystick, attacking with
 | or \   or   /  + Slash       | weapon for damage.
 O      O    O      or Kick     |
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

   This attack off the falcon is not as useful as it was in SS1.  Although
it is still quite confusing to some human challengers and you can attack
at different angles to produce confusion as to which direction to block.
But apart from this I don't usually use this move much.  It does hit
multiple times on all opponents if it hits (regardless whether your
opponents blocks it or not) so it is also useful as a finishing move
(but you need to worry about whether or not it will hit.... )  It does
have very high priority in the air and if anyone tries jumping to hit
you while you are on the falcon, executing this move will hit them out
cleanly.  Also you can use this move to escape corners - get on the
hawk, move the hawk up and out of the corner while watching for any
attacks from your opponent, and then Yatoro Poku off in the opposite
direction away.  Also see above section on 'Mamahaha Flight'.

   WEAKNESS:  In SS2 this move now lags after Nakoruru lands!!!  And
because Nakoruru spins so slowly sometimes the move will not hit
altogether...  If you miss your opponent with this move or if they block
it, you must quickly try either a crouching A or B slash or throw them
after you land and recover from your lag time.  The crouching A or B
slash will hit your opponent if they try an AB slash on you.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Kamui Mutsube (While flying)    | Flies down from Falcon in burning attack,
				| sword extended, hitting for fire damage.
  Slash or Kick (joystick must  |
  not be in the position for    |
  the Yatoro Poku move)         |
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

   Kamui Mutsube is now actually a better choice for attacking off
Mamahaha in my opinion.  It does more damamge to your opponent than
Yatoro Poku, has the same high priority in the air and you are guaranteed
that it will hit your opponent!  Like Yatoro Poku, this attack will take
multiple blocked damamge on your opponent.  Up to three ticks of blocked
damage can be achieved if you aim for your opponents' head at medium to
close range with Kamui Mutsube.  This move is thus great for finishing
the other fighters off when they don't have very much left and most
people don't know this.  It can also be used to get out of corners like
Yatoro Poku.  To compensate for the longer lag time, Kamui Mutsube
actually travels further away than Yatoro Poku, so it is actually a
better choice for getting out of the corner IMHO.  You can also use it
to attack so that it will hit your opponent at the back of his/her head
so that if they manage to block it, you will still be far away enough
not to be retaliated.

   WEAKNESS:  It does have a longer lag time than Yatoro Poku attack off
falcon so you must make sure you will hit them or you will finish them
off with this attack even when they block it.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Kamui Ryuse                     | Twirls around, whipping cloak out to 
				| create shield that reflects projectiles
 |   / O- + Slash               | back at opponents, as well as inflicting
 O O                            | damage.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

   Whipping the cloak about has several important uses actually.  The
most important one being that it makes you invulnerable to pet attacks
and also that it reflects projectiles.  This however takes a bit of
practice to get the timing right (sometimes I still have trouble
reflecting Kyoshiro's fans).  Also make sure you use A Kamui Ryuse to
reflect projectiles so that if your opponent jump over their own
projectile you will have time to block/counter.

   The second usage for this move is for air countering.  It works
fairly well as long as your opponent doesn't have an air slash attack
which stays out below his/her body when he/she is air-borne (e.g. Kamui
Ryuse will not work as an air counter against Ukyo's air AB).  It works
on all air kicks however (well, most of the ones I tried it on).

   Most people think that this move is not very powerful which it is not
if you only manage to hit your opponent with the edge of your cape.
However, if you can manage to envelope your opponent with the cape at
extreme close range and hit them.  This move does mega-damage, hits
multiple times and often dizzies your opponent!!!  So the best time to
use this move is when your opponent has missed an upper-cut special move
or when they are dizzy.  Then you should walk up to them and execute the
AB Kamui Ryuse at very close range and watch what happens (hee hee...)
I am also trying to walk under and then execute this move but has been
unsuccessful so far...  But it should be possible theoretically....

   Since it hits multiple times at close range, you can also use it to
finish up your opponent when they don't have much left and is knocked
down.  In this case, walk up to them and then execute an AB Kamui Ryuse
as they get up.

   WEAKNESS:  Again this move has a very long lag time after its
execution such that if you hit your opponent once with the edge of your
B or AB Kamui Ryuse they can recover quicker than you do and retaliate!
So make sure you don't do this move mindlessly...  Also because of the
joystick motion for the move sometimes Kamui Ryuse will come out when
you are actually trying to execute Amube Yatoro and thus put you at
grave situations (especially against Mizuki, she will always send that
energy pool on the ground whenever this happens...)

				| finishes by sending out a "shadow" of
 \   |   / O- -O | \   + BC     | Falcon, allowing for four consecutive hits
   O O O         O   O          | (if close to opponent).
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

   This 'not-so-secret-now' secret move for Nakoruru, while it doesn't
have the range nor the damage as Haohmaru's Tempa Fuzzin Zan, is quite a
nifty move in itself.  The first thing is that Nakoruru does not travel
very far forward in this 4-hitter and thus there is less fear of
retaliation afterwards (actually she almost ends up in the same position
as she started after the move is finished).  It does pretty good damage
if all 4 hits hit.  And, like Haohmaru's Tempa Fuzzin Zan, Nakoruru is
invulnerable to all projectile (and possibly pet attacks too) while she is
doing the first three quick Kamui Ryuses.  So use this move when your
opponent is dizzy for variety and style, or when your opponent does a
silly projectile (or pet attack?) at close range, or use it to finish an
opponent off who doesn't have very much energy left (the move actually
takes five ticks of blocked damage if all four cape whips connects because
the last whip with the cape stays out longer and takes two tick of blocked
energy).

   (note: When using this move on dizzied opponents, make sure you are
very close to ensure all 4 hits hit.  And also make sure your opponent is
not up against the corner because they won't get pushed back when hit
while you still moves forward with your move,  and therefore your
opponent will have a chance to escape/block the other hits or throw you
in the process.  Also don't use Apefunchi Kamui Rymuse when your
opponents' POW metre is nearly full as they will POWer up after blocking
or getting hit by the first one or two hits from this move and then you
will be thrown.

   You can also use it as an air counter like Kamui Ryuse if you want to.
Also, against all CPU characters (and some human characters with a
smaller weapons range), after you air AB an opponet out of the sky, you
can execute this move straight after you land to get some more blocked
damage without fear of being retaliated.

   WEAKNESS:  This move has a bit of a lag after execution and people
with long range attacks like Haohmaru or Ukyo can get you if they block
the move.

       O   O   O                | breaking damage.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

   Ok, this move looks good when it hits.  But it is not that useful.
You can try using it as an air counter like Amube Yatoro but it is hard
to time and get the spacing right.  I only use this when I am in range
and my opponent throws a slow-speed projectile.  Because the falcon
travels faster than the slow-speed projectile and cancels them in its
path while it still travels forward to get your opponent.  Even if it
doesn't cancel the opponents' projectile, as long as it hits the opponent 
first, Nakoruru will be invulnerable to the incoming projectile as five
more falcons plunge into your opponent's body on the ground.

   WEAKNESS:  Apart from the situation mentioned above, I will strongly
advise against using this move - especially against human opponents as
they will see it coming miles away.  Also because of the stuffed-up
special move recognition system in SS2 you will sometimes execute a
Mutsube move instead of the power special if you don't do it slowly
enough...

Some Normal Moves and Their Uses

(For the ground attacks, if not specified whether it is a close or far
attack, it means that either close or far attacks are the same, or it
applies to both)

Crouching C kick:  This move is very fast - great for keeping opponents
away when they are very close to you.

Crouching D kick:  This move has a slightly longer range than crouching
C kicks and comes out fairly fast.  But it retracts a bit slower, but you
are usually safe from retaliation even if your opponent blocks it.  Use
crouching D kicks also to keep your opponents away and is great for
combos (see combos section).

Crouching CD kicks:  This is an excellent air counter move against CPU
and also human challengers.  Just make sure the kick is out before your
opponents' air attacks and also your opponent is in front of you.  It is
also a vital move in demolishing CPU Genjuro (see Specific Character
Strategies section - Genjuro)  After you have air countered your opponent
with the crouching CD kick, send the falcon to get one more blocked
damage.

Standing close B and crouching B slashes:  They have limited range I
know.  But the good thing is that they are great in combos (see combos
section).  The moves are great for walking under and then slashing your
opponents with.  If your opponent 'reels back' on the ground after you
walk under and B slash him/her, follow it up with an A Annu Mutsube.  If
your opponent jumps back after you B slash them, send the falcon to get
one more blocked damage.

Crouching AB slash:  Another good air counter for Nakoruru.  Again you
must make sure the spacing/timing is right as if you miss with it you
will put yourself in grave danger.

Standing C kick:  Comes out fast and retracts fast enough to prevent
retaliation.  Great for keeping opponents away.  It is also particularly
useful for ticking (see Nakoruru Against Human Opponents).  The move is
also great against CPU Sieger (see Specific Character Strategies section
- Sieger)

Standing D kick:  Like standing C kick, this move is also great against
CPU Sieger (see Specific Character Strategies section - Sieger)

Standing close AB slash:  Thr first hit of this move, although it does not
hit ground opponents, is great air counter for jump-in opponents who is
nearly on top of you.  Hit AB when opponent has just gone past the highest
point in their jumping arc.  Can also use it for combos (see Combos
section).  Also, this move is interruptable in between the first hit
(lift sword up) and the second hit (slash down).  Therefore you can sort
of use it to fake an AB attack at close range and instead of slashing
down go straight into a special move to catch your opponent by surprise.

Standing far AB slash:  Mega damage move and can be used for air
counters on opponents landing in front of you (the move has the
same/similar animation frames as the jump-forward air ABs).  Hit AB when
your opponent is near the top of their jumping arc but haven't gone past
it yet.  Can also combo with this move (see Combos section)

Jumping forward/backward A, B and AB slashes:  Good priority air counter
attacks.  B and AB ones does very good damage and can be used in combos
(see Combos section).  For air counters make sure that only the knife
part touches your opponent so that the chance of your being slash/kick
out of the counter is minimised.  If using air AB to counter, make sure
that it has ample time to slash up before you meet the opponent in air.
Also see Special Moves Listing and Their Uses section - Apefunchi Kamui
Rymuse for relevant information.

Jumping straight-up A, B and AB slashes:  Good alternative air counters
for jump-in opponents who is nearly on top of you.  Again B and AB ones
does very good damage.

Jumping forward C, D, and CD kicks:  The three kicks are good offensive
air attacks for jumping in on your opposition.  They can also be used in
combos (See Combos Section)

Jumping straight-up CD kick:  This move stays out for quite long.  For
it's uses refer to the section Nakoruru Against Human Opponents section
(J1).

Triple Kicks                    | Grabs opponent, and steps over him/her,
 when close, -O + D or CD       | kicking three times for damage.

	     O                  |
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

   It doesn't really matter which throws you use I think as they all do
pretty much the same damage.  Although the AB/CD throws seem to do a
little big more than the B/D throws.  As with all the other 'hold'
throw, the AB throw without the weapon has a set number of hits now and
now it doesn't matter how furiously you pound on the joystick, the AB
weaponless throw will do exactly the same damamge.

   The air throw does more damamge than all the other throws.  It is a
good idea to get into a habit of pulling down on the joystick when you
jump in the air.  This way when you do a B or AB slash a throw will come
out in the right situation.

   A final note:  THROW AS MUCH AS YOU CAN!!!! (Especially against human
players...)

   When your weapon is stuck on the ground, your Mamahaha will decide to
take a rest and perch on your fallen sword.  Of course you should
immediately summon the lazy falcon back to aid you as quickly as possible
or pick up your sword.....  However, in SS2 Mamahaha now has a hearing
problem and Nakoruru needs to whistle on for quite a while to get its
attention, thus giving your opponent a good chance of hitting you when
you are whistling away so make sure you have plenty of room between you
and your opponent before you start calling your falcon back.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Misc.:  Nakoruru can do a 'triangle-jump' in which she firstly jump back
against the side of the screen and then bounces forward from the side of
the screen to reach an even greater height in her jumps.  To do this,
first jump back against the wall by pushing joystick to back/up
position, then push the joystick in a forward position.  However, if you
have done an attack in the air already when you jump back against the
wall, you cannot perform the triangle-jump (some people might have
played SF2 too much and in SF2 you can do this...)

==========================================================================

General CPU Strategies:

SS2's AI is a lot more intelligent and also aggressive than that of SS1.
Against Nakoruru, CPU controlled characters seem to advance upon Nakoruru
quite a lot.  They stay outside of Nakoruru's attack range and wait there
for you to make a move (where if you attack you will miss and if you jump
you will over jump).  And if you just crouch defending there the CPU will
move in and throw or jump in with an air attack and throw.  Nakoruru
players should be aware of this and know how to deal with this situation
when CPU is advancing upon you.

Below is a general summary of tactics for Nakoruru players when CPU is in
the above mentioned position (i.e. outside of your normal attack range but
within their own attack range).  Some of these are actually pretty basic
and applies to any human characters fighting CPU characters but anyway
here goes...

1. CPU runs towards you:  This happens quite a lot with for example CPU 
Galford and Wan-Fu.  This also happens when CPU is lower on the energy bar
and there is not a lot of time left.  Keep the CPU away with
crouching/standing C kicks and/or crouching D kicks.  Nakoruru can usually
get a few of these kicks in the CPU to tick off some damage.  Make sure
you stop the standing C kicks straight away when you have pushed them
outside of your standing C kick range and then go back into defensive
crouch.  Any missed moves on your part can cost you dearly.  If CPU has
already run in too close to you then you should do crouching C or D kicks
to keep them away and then maybe add one or two standing C kicks (again
make sure that you do NOT miss any crouching kicks).

2. CPU rolls towards you:  Be careful when CPU decide to roll toward you
just outside your attack range.  This happens in many situations.  For
example when you have kicked them in the face too many times with the
standing C kicks, or when you just crouch there and do nothing, or when
you send Mamahaha to attack at close range.

There are many ways to deal with CPU rolling in on you, and it depends on
where the CPU character is after rolling in.  If CPU will be very close
to you after rolling in (e.g. CPU might have rolled under your series of
standing C kicks).  When I say close, I mean the sprites of Nakoruru and
the opponent are overlapping.  In this case I would suggest that you
quickly get away.  CPU will usually throw after it comes out of the roll
and in very close situations like this counter-throwing is often
difficult.  Hop back, jump back with an air C kick or if you see it coming
or AB Leyla Mutsube to get away.

If CPU lands in front of you when it has finished rolling, then quickly do
a lot of crouching C kicks to push them away - you will usually get a few
hits like this.  As soon as they are outside your crouching C kick range,
switch to standing C kicks to push them away further.  If opponent's roll
finish in front of you, there is a better chance of throwing the opponent
so it is a viable option.

3. CPU just standing there doing nothing:  Since CPU is still outside your
attack range don't be foolish and try attacks on the spot which will miss.
CPU is very good at detecting this and then will use their advantage of
having a better range to hit you as you are recovering from your attacks.
Don't be tempted to jump forward - at this position if you jump forward
you will over-jump and will get slashed/kicked/thrown on the back as you
land.  And if you are corner-trapped don't be tempted to jump back against
the wall either.  CPU usually will find a good way to hit you out of the
air.  I will usually try moving forward a little bit at a time so that
opponent is in my standing C kick range and then try kicking them.
Sometimes CPU also backs off if you move forward bit by bit.  This has
proven to be quite useful.

4. CPU jumping in:  If when they jump in, they will be almost on top of
you, you must think of a way to counter their attack or escape.  If you
do not have time to escape/counter and blocked their move, immediately go
into crouching C kicks or do a crouching A slash when you have blocked
CPU's air attack - this will minimise your chance of getting thrown.
Refer to the Special Moves Listing and Their Uses section and Some
Normal Moves and Their Uses section for air counter moves.


Misc. General Strategies:

   a) Anticipating opponent's attack:  Since our Nakoruru has no range at
all for her attacks :-(, to beat opponents who just keep on using their
big range slashes, you must learn to anticipate and counter strike
successfully against every other characters in the game with a better
weapon-range.  The Mutsube moves should be used here.  Generally, you
should only attempt to use the A Mutsube moves as B or AB starts too
slowly.  Anticipating is hard to do against the CPU but nevertheless you
should try and it is vital you can do this when fending off human
challengers :-).  Many of other characters' standing slashes will miss
if you get your Mutsube moves out in time too - see Specific Character
Strategies section for more information.

   b) Luring your opponent to jump-in:  The only way Nakoruru is going win
against anyone (especially against CPU) is getting some of those nice air
ABs into your opponent.  But in SS2 the CPU rarely jumps.  So you must
find some ways to force them to.  To lure them to jump use Mamahaha,
sending the falcon to attack will usually make the CPU characters jump (if
not forward, then upward).  If they jump forward then you must find a way
to hit them out of the air.  Sometimes CPU also jumps in after blocking
your Mamahaha, and also after you have executed a B or AB Kamui Ryuse far
away.  See Specific Character Strategies section for a list of CPU 
characters with greater tendency to jump.

   c) Jump-in attacks:  Nakoruru's air attack does not have very much
range.  Also due to Nakoruru's long jumping arc it is very easy to 
over-jump and miss an attack completely.  First thing to make sure is that 
this does not happen.  CPU will murder you if you do.  Hop back until you 
have enough space and will not overjump.  Usually you will have enough 
space to jump in safely after your opponent blocks your A or B Mamahaha 
attack and gets pushed back.  When you have jumped in correctly make sure 
your air attack hits.  The safest attack to jump in with is of course 
Nakoruru's kicks.  But you can also use her B or AB slashes which does 
good damage and can be comboed afterwards.  Against small characters like 
Cham Cham it is safer to use the kicks since the air slashes will 
sometimes miss her if she is crouched.  If you have over-jumped, I would 
suggest you either try counter-throwing, doing a crouching AB roll slash 
or crouching C kicks or go into a A Mutsube move straight away as you 
land.  When jumping in, if opponent blocks your attack, you can try 
immediately throwing them when you land (if you are close to them) or do 
an attack that needs to be blocked low - CPU is usually susceptible to be 
hit by the first low attack you do after you jump in).  If the air attack 
hits combo them!!! (refer to combo section below)

   d) Dealing with opponents' projectiles:  See Special Moves Listing
and Their Uses section, and also Specific Character Strategies on this
subject.  Alternatively roll forward or lie flat on the floor and wait for
projectile to go past you.  Certain projectiles can be slashed off by
Nakoruru in SS1 (Tam Tam's Skull, Kyoshiro's flaming fans and Hanzo's
Shuriken) with her slashes.  It is still possible to do it in SS2.  At
least with Kyoshiro's fans you can slash it in half with Nakoruru's
standing A slash or the standing B slash.  Also, if you block an
opponent's projectile at a close range, you usually still have time to
nail them with an Annu Mutsube before they come out of their projectile
stun time.

   e) Opponent's missed/blocked normal moves:  Again, learn to counter any
missed normal moves and blocked AB slashes at close range with the A 
a list of normal moves which can be retaliated/countered with the Mutsube
moves.

   f) Opponents' missed/blocked special moves:  It seems that there is
generally a slight lag whenever a characters land from special moves.  So 
it is a lot easier to retaliate when you block an opponent's special moves 
or if opponent misses with their special moves.  See Special Moves
Listing and Their Uses - Kamui Ryuse, and Combos Sections for more
information.

   g) Countering opponents' special moves:  Many of the other fighters'
special moves can be countered using Nakoruru's Mutsube moves.  Refer to
the specific opponent strategies section below.

   h) When CPU's POW metre is full:  Be careful, although CPU doesn't do
it often, when CPU's POW metre is full you should think twice about
jumping in.  Many CPU characters are programmed to execute their power
special if you jump in and their POW metre is full.  Or when you are
trapped in the corner and CPU's POW metre is full, don't be tempted to
jump back against the wall with a C kick hoping that CPU will move forward
and get hit, they will simply do their power special!

   i) When your opponent is dizzy:  Refer to Special Move Listing (Kamui
Ryuse and Apefunchi Kamui Rymuse) and Their Uses section and Combos section
to see how you can best inflict mega damage on your opponents.

   j) Getting out of the corner when trapped:  Refer to Special Move
Listing and Their Uses - Leyla Mutsube, Yatoro Poku and Kamui Mutsube.

   k) Finishing off your opponent:  Refer to Special Moves Listing and
Their Uses for a list of multiple-hit special moves to finish off a
nearly-dead opponent with lots of style....

Nakoruru Against Human Opponents
   
Although Nakoruru is not great as a character for challenging, 
nevertheless I dutifully tried using her at the local arcade in Taiwan
(I was on a short holiday overseas...) which was infested with lots of
Haohmarus and Ukyos.  After a great deal of practise (and loss of money),
I can finally defeat average challengers most of the time and also
sometimes beat advanced human challengers.  So I feel it is time for me
to include some tips on this subject - but if you have any good tips
against against any human characters please let me know.....

   a) Staying close to your opponent (ticking):  Okay, now our Nak has
hardly any range for her attacks, and her long range falcon summon is 
really not that hard to avoid.  So what does a Nak player do to win?  
Stay close to your opponent and tick the !#^&@$ out of your opponent!!!
Move in closer bit by bit until you are within your standing C kick range,
and then standing C kick, move forward, standing C kick etc.  You get the
idea.  Don't get monotonous with this, your opponent will try a quick 
A slash on you usually as you do your standing C kicks but usually your
standing C kick is faster than theirs.  Just make sure you don't miss.  
Also, vary the attack pattern.  Tick once or twice and then Annu Mutsube
(at the same time your opponent is trying to get even with his/her longer
range attacks), or tick and then run in and throw (see below)

   b) Running in:  To make up for Nakoruru's lack of range in her attacks.
You must learn to use run-ins effectively.  Run in and throw is a 
MUST-HAVE skill for any Nakoruru players.  OK, this is considered as 
'cheap' by some but if they cannot counter it it is their incompetence as 
it is counterable.  Firstly, get to know Nakoruru's throw range properly.  
Then, practise running in, and then as soon as you get into range press 
one of the throw buttons.  I personally like the D throw the best and it 
seems to work best for me.  Only do this run and throw thing if you start 
running at medium to close range (so your opponent doesn't have enough
time to react).  After a few of these run-and-throws your opponent will be 
expecting a throw when you start running, then vary your tactics - run in 
and then A Annu Mutsube, run in and go back into defensive crouch, run in
and do a standing C or D kick, or crouching A or B slash, or run in and
then jump forward (over those Haohmaru ABs and Bs...) etc.

   c) Rolling:  Rolling forward and throw also works.  But make sure you
roll in at very close range so Nakoruru's sprite overlaps with your 
opponents' sprites at a very early stage of the roll so that they cannot
crouch-attacking you out of the roll.  Then push forward and start 
pressing your throw button...  You can also do a variation of (b) as
mentioned above by running forward, and then as soon as you run close to
your throw range push the joystick to offensive crouch position to roll
forward and then throw.  Do this if your opponent gets to used to your
other running-in and throw tactics.  

   d) Dealing with projectiles revisited:  People who has not played very
much against human Nakoruru's don't usually know that Nakoruru can slide
through/under many projectiles.  So if they are stupid enough to do the
move and the situation is right for you Annu Mutsube through to hit them!
Also, human players have a higher tendency to throw projectiles to you 
(and also at a closer range), make sure you get them afterwards after 
blocking a close range projectile (say, they did the projectile as you 
get up at close range) or again slide through with Annu Mutsube, or 
reflect it if you can.  A note on reflecting projectiles, use it only
when opponents throw their projectiles at close, medium range so that 
your opponent has less time to react to it.  After you reflect it, move
forward.  If your opponent jump forward over their own projectile, air AB
slash them out of the air, or if they jump upwards, Leyla Mutsube to get
them.  If they block it, send Mamahaha to attack at the same time.  
Sometimes, your opponent they will move forward a bit and then jump 
forward straight after they throw their projectile, anticipating your
reflecting of the projectile so watch out.

   e) Punish any close-range or missed B/AB attacks on you:  Referring to
the list in the Specific Character Strategies section, if your opponent
miss any of their AB attacks, or if you block their long-lagtime attacks
at close range, makes sure you make them pay.

   f) Know all your air counters:  Againt the CPU usually all you need to
know how to do is the air AB and crouching CD kick for air defence.  But
against human opponents, mix up your air countering tactics (they are many
you can use which will work in the same situation) so that you don't get
too predictable.  Especially if you are used to use air AB as air counter,
sometimes substitute say a close standing AB as air counter as if you get
too predictable, your opponent will simply jump in with a C kick instead 
and you will be hit out of the air AB a lot easier.  The only one I will 
use extensively is walking under and throw/attack.  Don't miss any chance
of an air counter as a good human player will seldom jump against you...

   g) Luring your opponents to make mistakes:  Well I can only give
examples here: 
   
   (1) When you knock someone down, go up to them and do a standing far 
       AB timed such that you will finish the move at the same time that 
       your opponent can attack.  Many people get fooled by this and will
       attempt a slash or block.  Then since you are quite close, do a 
       crouching B slash to hit them (if they are attempting to slash you 
       in anyway), or if they are simply blocking, move in and throw.  

   (2) Execute an A Annu Mutsube so that you will finish the move just
       outside your opponents' furtherest attack range, then then do 
       another A Annu Mutsube if your opponent attempts to slash you
       with their big-range ABs.

   h) Opponents running in:  Many good players will also try the running
tactics I stated above on you.  There are many ways to deal with this.  
As with the CPU, the safest is of course to do the standing C kick.  But
watch out for them stopping early and slashing you with their longer range
attacks.  Or you can try A Annu Mutsube as they run in to quite a close 
range.  It usually catches them off-guard and will get them.  And of 
course counter-throwing is very important.  If your opponents run in and
then stops not too far away from you, run in and throw them also works.  
Watch out for Haohmarus or Genjuros running in and then doing their 
upper-cut special moves.  Also watch for people with sliding attacks like
Cham Cham's sliding kick running in and then sliding attack you.

   i) Know your opponents' attack ranges:  You must know by heart all
your opponents' weapon ranges.  In your quest to move in closer to them, 
many people will try and catch you off guard with one of their big ABs
or CD kicks, or when you have made to closer to them, it will then be the
A, B slashes or C, D kicks.  If you don't know what to expect then you 
are more likely to be caught and hit by one of those when you try to move
forward.  If you know these attacks ranges well, you can anticipate and
counter, or stay just outside these ranges and then if your opponents
don't know the ranges as well as you do and miss, Annu Mutsube to get 
them.  This is quite hard at first but it gets easier as you get more
experienced with the game I guess.

   j) Other things to remember/try:  Another list of examples....

   (1) When you have knocked down someone, stand next to them, jump 
   straight up and then do a CD kick in the air as your opponent gets up,
   this must make them block.  Then you land and throw.  Or if they get 
   hit, then do an A Annu Mutsube.

   (2) Get on the falcon at medium to close range, move the falcon up 
   to give yourself a bit of room.  And if your opponent tries to jump
   up and attack you or get your with an upper-cut special move, get them
   with a Kamui Mutsube off the falcon immediately.  

=========================================================================

Combos:

SS2's combo system as I understand it:  It seems to me that in SS2, when
a character is hit, only the first few 'reeling back' frames can be hit
by a subsequent attack.  If your opponent's 'reeling back' frame goes
beyond those first few frames they won't be hit.  So when comboing you
must make sure your second hit hits your opponent before your opponent
'reels back' too much.

Combos in SS is mainly based on using a short-range attack followed by 
a longer range attack and so on.  Since Nakoruru lacks in long-range
attacks it is harder for her.  But two-hit combos on the ground with
just normal moves are quite possible when you are really close.  For
example:

   a) crouching C kick followed by crouching CD kick.
   b) standing close A or B slash followed by crouching or standing CD 
      kick.
   c) crouching C or D kick, standing C or D kick.

etc...  experiment and see what works and get into the habit of executing
the second attack of the above if the first one hits.

Other multi-hitters include the crouching AB roll, standing close CD
kick, jumping straight-up CD kick (if executed very late before you
land), Kamui Ryuse, Leyla Mutsube and Annu Mutsube.  These moves will hit
opponent twice if executed at very close range.  Apefunchi Kamui Rymuse
hits four times maximum.

Mutsube moves can be chained also after some medium and heavy attacks to
form 2-hit combos, too.  These attacks are:  close standing B slash, close
standing D kick, crouching D kick, crouching B slash, close standing AB
slash and far standing AB slash.  A Annu/Leyla Mutsube should be used
after the medium attacks (B slashes and D kicks) and B Annu Mutsube should
be used after the heavy attacks.  Refer to the combos (3) and (8) below
for more information.

Here are some more possible combos:

-------------------------------------------------------------------------
1) Air AB slash or air CD kick, A/B/AB Annu Mutsube.

Against small characters like Cham Cham and Nicotine use CD kick instead
of AB slash since AB slash is a down-to-up slash and can easily miss on
these characters.  You must make sure your AB strike fairly late before
you land for this combo to work. Otherwise your Annu Mutsube will not
hit them even though they are not blocking yet.  Try to use A Annu Mutsube
more as it comes out faster.

NOTE: the above combo does not work on Kyoshiro often for some strange
reason...  Kyoshiro seems to go into the invulnerable part of the reeling
back frame a lot faster than anyone else....  So unless you strike
Kyoshiro with the AB in the last possible moment before you land, don't
attempt this combo.

A variation of (1) is to substitute the air AB with either air B or air
D, but with these two you must make sure you hit your opponent in fairly
late before you land and you must be close.  The second attack must be
an A Annu Mutsube in this case.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------
2) Air C kick, close standing B slash or crouching B slash into A
Annu/Leyla Mutsube (carried over from SS1).

If you use standing slash for the second hit you should combo with Annu
Mutsube, if you use crouching slash for the second hit use Leyla Mutsube
for the third hit (this is just a suggestion for fluid joystick movement
since when you do standing close B slash you will most of the time be
pulling back, then it is easier to just move the joystick down to do Annu
Mutsube.  And similarly if you are crouching attacking it is more natural
to move the joystick from that position to do Leyla Mutsube).  And note
you must be very close for the second attack (character sprites must be
nearly overlapping or even closer) so that the opponent will not have
enough time to recover to block the third Mutsube attack.

A variation of (2) is to substitute the first air attack with either air
B slash or air D kick, but the air B or D attack must hit your opponent
at the back of their head (i.e. you must be extremely close) or otherwise
the second B slash will miss.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------
3) Close standing or crouching B slash, A Annu/Leyla Mutsube.

This is basically (2) without the air attack.  Can also use close standind
or crouching D kick instead of the B slash for the first attack.  You must
make sure you execute the A Annu Mutsube as fast as possible after the
first attack hits or otherwise sometimes you will miss.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------
4) Air attack, crouching AB roll slash

You will get 3 hits if you don't use air AB or air CD kick for the first
air attack.  If you use air AB or CD the crouching AB roll will only hit
once for 2 hits altogether.)

-------------------------------------------------------------------------
5) for a easy combo, do air C kick, one or two crouching C kicks and 
ending with a standing C kick (optional).

-------------------------------------------------------------------------
6) Air attack (not AB or CD), crouching C/D kick or crouching A/B slash 
and then CD kick works fairly well.  

-------------------------------------------------------------------------
7) Carried over combo from SS1:  Start the joystick motion for Mamahaha
attack by pushing the joystick to forward position and at the same time 
do a standing close A slash, then as the joystick in moved in a backward 
continuous half-circle motion, do a crouching A slash as the joystick is 
moved to the down position, and then complete the half-circle motion and 
press A for the Mamahaha attack for 3 hits (haven't really tried this to
see if it still works).

-------------------------------------------------------------------------
8) Standing far/close AB slash, B or AB Annu Mutsube

This combo is good for retaliating blocked/missed upper-cut-like special
moves or when opponent is dizzy - mega damage like combo 1 - especially
if you use standing far AB slash for the first hit.

NOTE: this combo does not work on Kyoshiro AT ALL for some strange
reason...  Kyoshiro seems to go into the invulnerable part of the reeling
back frame a lot faster than anyone else....  Against Kyoshiro use combo
(3) instead.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------
9) Air B slash or D kick, Apefunchi Kamui Rymuse

The trick is to start the joystick motion for Apefunchi Kamui Rymuse in
the air - even before your air attack.  If you are very close after the
air B or D, you can use a A Kamui Ryuse instead of Apefunchi Kamui
Rymuse.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------
10) Air AB or CD, start the joystick for Amube Yatoro as you land from
the air attack, after landing and as the joystick passes to the down 
position do a crouching B slash, and then complete the joystick motion 
and do an A Amube Yatoro. (not verified)

-------------------------------------------------------------------------
11) Very close air AB slash or CD kick, crouching CD kick.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------

Ending for Nakoruru:

Below is a description of the Nakoruru ending.  It is a mixture between
Robert DeLoura (a translation from the Japanese ending) and the ending
taken from SS2 TAPFAQ (the ending of the English version of SS2).

I will only add here that Nakoruru's sister (Rimururu in Japanese
translation) doesn't have a name in the English version, and she doesn't
call Nakoruru 'sister' in the English translation, she just calls
Nakoruru by name.)

The standard canned bit takes place first... that's the same for 
everyone.

The standard forest scene.
Cut to Nakoruru, stretched out on the ground unconscious, with Mamahaha
perched on her.  Poppy walks in, and does her "crying" animation (she 
does this in the game sometimes when Galford loses) from across the 
screen.  Galford walks in behind Poppy, and says "Nakoruru!".

Nakoruru sits up and says, "Galford...".

Galford says something like, "I was worried about you"

Nakoruru says, "...Galford...I...."

The forest starts to flash red, and Nakoruru jumps up on Mamahaha (the
falcon-carry move).  Galford says, "Nakoruru!" again.

Nakoruru says, "The forest is still being destroyed by evil power.  I must 
go."  She flies away on Mamahaha.

Cut to that rocky outcropping that everyone stands on just before they 
go to fight Mizuki in the game.  

Nakoruru then says something like "God of great nature, save them and the
forest... please...."

A wide beam of light strikes Nakoruru, and she turns into a small ball 
of light, which rises up and radiates out into the forest (which is
still flashing red), after the small ball of light vanishes into the
forest, the forest goes back to normal.  Her sword falls to the ground,
and Mamahaha chirps.

Cut back to Nakoruru's village.  Mamahaha has apparently brought the sword
back.  Nakoruru's parents are there, and the girl being held by the bear
in the background of Nakoruru's stage is there also.  (She is Nakoruru's
sister, Rimururu.  The name might be different in the English version, but
that's her name in the Japanese one.)  Rimururu is holding Nakoruru's
sword, and says "Sister...."

The sword glows, and Rimururu says, "That voice is... sister?"
(in the English version, the sword glows and says "This is Nakoruru's
voice" instead)

The scene cuts to a background that's an air-brushed picture of Nakoruru,
and text is overlaid on top of the picture.  The text says, "Please don't
cry...My soul will always be here as a guardian of nature.  From now, you
have to fight to protect them."  The scene fades back to the family, and
Rimururu stands up and says, "I understand... Sister."

-- END --

Specific Opponent Strategies:

The following section contains general CPU patterns and strategies against
CPU specific to each fighter, a list of a characters' normal moves (and 
how they can be countered/retaliated), a list of each fighter's special 
moves and how they can be countered/retaliated), and a section called
human opponent pattern/strategies, which describes what patterns a human
challenger might use against your Nakoruru and how to deal with them.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------

Cham Cham:  

CPU patterns/general:
   - Missed Leyla Mutsube will get countered by CPU with boomerangs
   - Use kicks when jump attacking since the slashes will generally miss.
   - Keep Cham Cham at approximately the position of your B Amube Yatoro
     attack and do the B Amube Yatoro.  Cham Cham will sooner or later
     jump over it or block it and then jump over it.  Then counter her
     out of the sky with air ABs, Leyla Mutsube or crouching CD kick.
   - Make sure you can determine whether Cham Cham is jumping normally or
     is doing a jumping scratch (Cham Cham shouts "Heh!" when she does the
     jumping scratch and she shouts "Jump!" when she jumps).  Also her
     jump is faster when she does the jumping scratch.
   - Also make sure you can determine which way to block the jumping
     scratch - you need to block FORWARD when the jumping scratch lands
     just behind you and thus reversing the joystick motion for blocking.

Special move counters:
   Boomerang:  With the horizontal Boomerang, I have Annu Mutsubed under
   it a couple of times but it depends on when you Mutsube through and
   also on which Boomerang toss Cham Cham used (A, B or AB).  The
   horizontal boomerang curves slightly downwards as it travels so say
   if Cham Cham used AB Boomerang and you are far away you can NOT Annu
   Mutsube through it.  However, if you are close and see the move coming,
   you can most of the time Annu Mutsube though it, or if you are close
   enough, block it, and then Annu Mutsube to hit Cham Cham while she is
   still recovering from her Boomerang stun time.

   Jumping Scratch:  There are many ways to counter this move....

   To counter without blocking, do a standing close AB slash when Cham
   Cham comes into range with the jumping scratch.  Or if you are an
   expert with timing and spacing, you can try jumping back with a C or
   D kick or A or B slash to get her but I can only do this sometimes.
   I think a well-timed Kamui Ryuse will also get Cham Cham.

   Or you can block the jumping scratch and retaliate afterwards.  You 
   must get her before she lands as Cham Cham doesn't have a lag time 
   after landing from a blocking jumping scratch.  A and B Leyla Mutsube
   can be successfully used to get her most of the time.  If Cham Cham is
   relatively close to you after bouncing back, you can run to get into
   range and do a standing far AB to hit her out before she lands.

   You can also make her miss by hopping/rolling back or running/rolling
   forward.  If Cham Cham misses (i.e. lying flat on the ground), Annu
   Mutsube and crouching AB roll will hit her as she lies flat on the
   ground.  Of course you can also use the crouching kicks but they
   don't do as much damage.

   (note: don't try countering the jumping scratch with Leyla or Annu
   Mutsube without first blocking it, the jumping scratch cancels the
   Mutsube moves)
   
   Lion Rush (Power Special):  Block and retaliate with any attack.

   Mura Gaburu (Paku Paku toss an skull):  Reflect using Kamui Ryuse.
   Might be able to slash it off like in SS1...  You CANNOT Annu Mutsube
   under the skull because it is so low now.

   Pakupaku Deos (Paku Paku spins forward):  Kamui Ryuse (Make yourself
   invulnerable to it) or you can Annu Mutsube through Paku Paku safely
   too (make sure you are already away and sliding when you meet Paku Paku
   with the Annu Mutsube.

   Paku Gaburu (Paku Paku rises and spits a fireball):  If you are sure
   you can Annu Mutsube through it before the fireball explodes on the 
   ground, then do it!!  You will hit Cham Cham along with it too.  Or 
   otherwise jump away or block it (make sure you have enough energy left 
   to block it!)                                
   
Normal Move Counters:
   Crouching CD kick (sliding):  If see it coming, Annu Mutsube straight
   through, or the crouching AB slash will hit her out.  Or if close (Cham
   Cham is still sliding after you block), retaliate after blocking.

Human Player Patterns/Strategy:
   (1) Crouching D kick until you are out of range, then crouching CD
       kick you:  Know the pattern and then Annu Mutsube after you have
       been pushed out of range by the crouching D kick.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------

Charlotte:  

CPU patterns/general:
   - If trapped against the wall and CPU Charlotte is very close it's
     usually safe to just AB Leyla Mutsube away to get out.
   - Get on the falcon and immediately start moving the falcon up and
     over Charlotte.  CPU Charlotte is programmed to do her AB power
     gradation in this situation.  When you see this coming, quickly
     Yatoro Poku off the falcon to avoid the Power Gradation, and then
     combo Charlotte as she lands from her missed power gradation (combo
     3 or 7)!
   - Don't jump or hop back at close range or will be hit by her quick A
     pokes.
   - Don't do any missed attack or Charlotte will poke you with her
     weapon.
   - Get away so you have enough distance to jump in.  Then jump in with
     a air D kick (for more damage), and if she blocks and you land close
     enough do either a crouching D kick and she will usually get hit by
     the second attack from you.  After that do a standing C kick to push
     her away.  If any of the D kicks hit follow up with an A Annu
     Mutsube.
   - Never jump in with a slash!  Charlotte's standing D kick and Power
     Gradation will get you before yours hit her.

Special move counters:
   Power Gradation:  Block and retaliate - see combo section, Special
   Moves Listing and Their Uses Section (Kamui Ryuse, Apefunchi Kamui
   Rymuse).

   Splash Fount: If Charlotte does her splash fount from far away and you 
   have time to get your Annu Mutsube out (i.e. Nakoruru has time to start 
   sliding before Splash Fount hit you), then Annu Mutsube will hit her 
   out.  Otherwise, if you are too close to the move to get your Annu
   Mutsube started, you need to block FIRST, and Annu Mutsube afterwards.
   Or jump over and retaliate from the other side.

   Splash Gradation (Power Special):  Block it and then as the 7-pointed
   star starts fading, Annu Mutsube through to hit Charlotte.
   
   Sword Flash (Triangle Projectile):  Kamui Ryuse to reflect it or Annu
   Mutsube under it.

Normal Move Counters:

Human Player Patterns/Strategy:

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
		       
Earthquake:  

CPU pattern/general:
   - Jump in on CPU Earthquake STRAIGHT AWAY at the beginning of each
     round as CPU Earthquake nearly always attacks with a A or B slash
     at the start of a round.  Then combo him after jumping as he is
     still retracting from his first weapon attack.
   - Generally just jump in and attack and attack and combo him if air
     attack gets him.  If he blocks your jump-in attack, when you land do
     a crouching kick or slash which will usually hit him.
   - If CPU jump towards you counter with air AB slash will usually work.
   - Be careful when sending Mamahaha away, since Earthquake now can do
     portal drop he will do that sometimes as you send the bird away.
     Also don't send Mamahaha away when you are too close or you will eat
     a crouching AB.
   - Earthquake will sometimes do a Fat Copy and then go straight into his
     Power Special as well so watch out for it.

Special move counters: 
   Fat Bounce (bouncing butt attack): The safest thing to do is to send
   Mamahaha to burn him but Leyla Mutsube through his fat butt looks more
   'stylish' :-)  But you have to make sure again that Nakoruru's knife 
   slice through Earthquake first before any part of her body touches 
   Earthquake.  Or otherwise it is a trade usually.  Also you can just 
   jump and slash him out of it, or do a standing slash will also work.

   Fat Chainsaw:  Annu Mutsube through it will hit him out.  Or if too
   close, block and then Annu Mutsube or crouching AB roll slash.
   
   Fat Press:  Jump in over the flame and attack Earthquake (yes you can
   do it), or if not sure jump over him and attack from the other side.
   If you need to, block it all and nail him with an Annu Mutsube 
   afterwards.

   Fat Copy:  If you are not in between the two images, just AB Annu
   Mutsube through both images.  The bomb that appears from the false
   image won't explode in your face since you already slide past it and
   you will hit the real image too.  If you are in between the two image,
   you can look at the top of the screen where Earthquake's name is
   displayed, it is replaced by the motion of the move he performs so you
   can work out which image he is from the button pressed (A=left,
   B=right).  Otherwise just take your pick I guess....
   
   Portal Drop:  There are two ways to counter this....

   You can either do a standing close AB slash to counter as Earthquake
   falls down on you from the sky - thus not blocking at all. (maybe a
   Kamui Ryuse or crouching AB slash will work too)

   Or you can block and then B Annu Mutsube to get him as he lands.  You
   can also do a last-minute Annu/Leyla Mutsube just before Earthquake
   hits you with the belly attack from above.  You can NOT do this when
   countering Galford and Hanzo's portal drop since they attack with their
   swords (which is steel) instead of their bellies (which is flesh :-) )
	
   Yo Yo Gama (Power Special):  Can Annu Mutsube through provided you 
   slide through when blue hand is waving up.  Therefore, you should Annu 
   Mutsube straight away after the blue hand has waved down.  This way you 
   will get Earthquake 100% of the time.  Alternatively send Mamahaha to
   get him.  Or jump over and attack from the other side.

Normal Move Counters:
   Crouching AB slash:  Block it, and as soon as Earthquake's weapon
   travels past you, Annu Mutsube to hit him.

Human Player Patterns/Strategy:

--------------------------------------------------------------------------

Galford:  

CPU pattern/general:
   - Keep CPU Galford away with lots of standing C kicks which will hit
     many times even if CPU is at high difficulty level.  Stop the kicks
     as soon as you are out of your attack range.
   - Take advantage when Galford jumps, if you can walk under him, then
     standing B slash him on his back as he lands.
   - Get on Mamahaha, CPU Galford will either do a portal drop himself,
     or send the dog to drop from the sky.  If he sends the dog, quickly
     Kamui Mutsube off the bird to get him!  The dog will drop at the
     position where the falcon was so you won't get hit.  If Galford
     does the Portal Drop himself, a well-timed Kamui Mutsube will also
     hit him out.  Or quickly Yatoro Poku off the bird, then block
     Galford's Portal Drop and then retaliate.
   - When Galford executes the Dog Rush move, the dog rushing forward
     has a colour outline.  You can slide through this move.  The Machine
     Gun Dog move does not.  So if you want to Mutsube through the dog
     make sure you can distinguish between the two of them.  Also the
     Rush Dog is a lot faster then either the Machine Gun dog or Replica
     Dog.

Special move counters:
   Fake Wood/Portal Drop:  The same counter as with Earthquake.

   Invisibility:  Find him!  When Galford turns invisible he isn't 
   entirely 'invisible'.  You can tell what he is doing by sounds, like 
   the 'whooshing' when they jump or the footfalls when they run.

   Most importantly though it isn't necessary to strike him to know where
   he is.  Swinging away with Nakoruru's limited range isn't helpful.  
   The key to knowing where he is lies in looking at Kuroko.  He always 
   places himself in between the two fighting characters.

   This fact is useful because from that you can roughly guess where the
   invisible ninja is (IE:  If the ninja is approaching you, Kuroko will 
   be moving towards you as well.  If he is running then Kuroko will stay 
   in place and you 'should' hear footfalls).

   Kuroko only stays in place when (obviously) both characters don't move 
   or one character jumps/hops/runs (well, he also stays in place if 
   there's been a blocked slash : where he'll shake his head or a hit 
   slash: where he'll raise a flag.  Either one being irrelevant because 
   then the ninja will have given away his position). 

   Machine Gun Dog:  use Kamui Ryuse, cannot use Annu Mutsube since this
   cancels Annu Mutsube out and you will get munched to death by the dog.

   Plasma Blade:  Reflect using Kamui Ryuse, or Annu Mutsube under it.
   
   Poppy Power (Power Special):  Jump over it and attack.

   Replica Dog:  If you see it coming and Galford is relatively close,
   Annu Mutsube to hit Galford before the dog reappears.  Or if you see
   it coming hop/roll back or run/roll forward and the dog will miss.
   Don't know if Annu Mutsube cancels it or if Kamui Ryuse works?

   Rush Dog:  Annu Mutsube through it or use Kamui Ryuse to make your-
   self invulnerable to it.  Make sure you are already sliding with your
   swords extended when you meet poppy.

   Shadow Copy:  The same counter as with Earthquake's Fat Copy.

   Strike Hez (SPD-like throw):  Pray that he doesn't get that off on
   you!!!!

Normal Move Counters:
   Crouching AB slash:  Block and Annu Mutsube.

Human Player Patterns/Strategy:  
   (1) There is a expert Galford player here locally you can nearly always
       run in and Strike Hez me as I am getting up from being knocked down 
       and I don't know how to counter it - if anyone has any ideas please 
       tell me...

   (2) Galford players love their standing far Bs and crouching CD kicks 
       so watch out for those when you try to move in.  Galford is like 
       Nakoruru - fast but with a lot more range so it is quite tough for 
       Nak.  Don't jump too much or you will be air ABed to death since 
       Galford has a lot more air range than you do and is just as fast 
       with his air AB.

   (3) Watch out when Human player does the Shadow Copy, retaliate
       immediately.  Good Galford player can always Strike Hez you as the
       2 image appear on the screen straight away so you need to be fast.

Gen-An Shiranui:  

CPU pattern/general:
   - Missed or Blocked Leyla Mutsubes will be countered with a Butcher
     Thrust by CPU.
   - CPU Gen-An also uses the quick sliding D/CD kick a lot when he is
     close in succession.  Make sure you block all of them low.  Note
     that Gen-An kicks up after sliding in when he does the crouching CD
     kick.  Also CPU Gen-An sometimes will do a quick crouching A slash
     after sliding in with a kick so watch out.
   - CPU Gen-An jumps a lot.  Whenever Gen-An jumps, air AB slash him
     out of the sky.
   - Nearly every time after CPU Gen-An blocks your Mamahaha he will jump
     forward.  Also at the start of the round he will usually triangle
     jump off the wall or just jump forward about 45% of the time.

Special move counters:
   Butcher Thrust:  If have time, Annu/Leyla Mutsube through it will
   counter.  Or Block it, and Annu/Leyla Mutsube to retaliate as he spins 
   back.  When using the Mutsube moves to counter the Butcher Thrust, you
   must make sure the Butcher Thrust move doesn't touch Nakoruru from the
   top or she will be hit out of the Mutsube or will trade damage with
   Gen-An (i.e. Nakoruru's knife MUST meet Gen-An's spin first before any
   other part of her body).

   Or you can block it, then send Mamahaha to attack but this is harder to
   time.  Or you can use standing far B slash to slash him out of it 
   quite easily.  Standing C kick also kick him out of this move easily.
   If you meet his Butcher Thrust in the air and you are on top sometimes
   your air kicks will also hit him out of the Butcher Thrust.

   Death Twister (Power Special):  Not quite sure if you can jump in on
   it.  Send Mamahaha to burn him if you have time.  Or otherwise block
   and then retaliate with anything.

   Glove Extension:  If hit by it, usually you will have enough time to
   wiggle your way out of the dizzy and maybe retaliate with a Annu
   Mutsube.  If you block it, you can also immediately go into an A Annu
   Mutsube to  hit Gen-An but this needs really good timing.  It is also
   possible to Annu Mutsube under the Glove Extension without blocking at
   all.

   Poison Blizzard:  Jump in and attack him.  Or just block or reflect it
   with your cape.  Or Annu Mutsube through the cloud.

   Second Skin:  Wait for Gen-An to spin forward, block it and then A or
   B Leyla Mutsube to get him as he spins backward.  Or you can counter
   it with a Leyla Mutsube without blocking if you are far enough away
   such that only knife Portion hits Gen-An first.  If Gen-An misses with
   it and lands close to you just slash him with anything before he lands.
   When Gen-An is emerging from the skin, if you are close enough do a
   Leyla Mutsube which hits him just as he starts to spin upward.  This
   also hits him out of the move.  Or time a falcon attack so that the
   falcon hits him as he emerges from the skin to spin upwards also works.

Normal Move Counters:
   (1) Standing far AB: If you see Gen-An start his long-range AB, you
       will have time to hit him either before he hits you (Annu Mutsube
       when you see his first AB animation frame) or after (block it and
       Annu Mutsube).

Human Player Patterns/Strategy:
   (1) Good Gen-An players will utilise Gen-An's crouching A, B slashes
       and the crouching D and CD kicks.  A very popular pattern is that
       Gen-An does the crouching D sliding kick a couple of times until he
       gets relatively close and throw.  Or he does one or two sliding D
       kicks and then follow it up with a crouching A or B slash.  So know
       these patterns and don't fall for it.  A well-timed crouching
       attack after blocking Gen-An's sliding kick will usually break
       the pattern.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------

Genjuro (Kibagami Genjuro):  

CPU pattern/general:
   All the following strategy is based on crouch CD kicking CPU Genjuro
   at the maximum range of the crouching CD kick (or just outside the
   range).  So try to stay at this position all the time and crouching
   CD kick CPU Genjuro and act on CPU's reaction to it described below:
   - CPU Genjuro will sometimes at the same time try an attack on you
     (Oukazan, or just a slash or something).  But in doing so he will
     be hit by your crouching CD kick.
   - CPU Genjuro might run in or walking forward (to throw you) as your
     crouching CD kick is retracting, in this case quickly start your
     crouching C or D kicks as soon as you retract from your crouching
     CD kick.  If you use a D kick and it hits then follow up with A
     Annu Mutsube.
   - CPU Genjuro also might try a BC hop above your crouching CD kick,
     but as your crouching CD kick stays out quite long he will still
     get hit by it since the BC hop is quite short.
   - CPU Genjuro will also sometimes anticipate your crouching CD kick
     with perfect timing and jump forward, but at the distance specified
     above (i.e. at the maximum range of your crouching CD kick), he will
     over-jump and you will have just enough time to slash him on the
     back with a standing close B (and don't forget to follow up with
     either an Annu Mutsube or a Amube Yatoro)
   - CPU might jump straight up in response to your crouching CD kick and
     then do an air AB as he is coming down.  I haven't worked out how to
     deal with this yet except for just blocking it since you don't have
     much time after you retract from your crouching CD kick.  Maybe it's
     possible to Mutsube Genjuro in time in this case (I've never tried
     though).

   Other things to be aware of:
   - Don't do AB Leyla Mutsube to get out of his way - or he will send his
     projectile cards after you when you land!
   - Use Amube Yatoro to attack often, Genjuro doesn't jump over the bird
     very much.  But he will jump forward AFTER he blocks it often.  If he
     does jump forward, counter with a crouching CD kick or an air AB.

Special move counters:
   Card Game (Power Special):  Block and A Annu Mutsube to retaliate only
   if Genjuro is very close when he attempted the Power Special (i.e.
   Genjuro is within your A Annu Mutsube range he is close enough).

   Oukazan (card projectile):  Reflect using Kamui Ryuse or Annu Mutsube
   under it.

   Sanrensatsu (dashing slashes):  Annu Mutsube will hit Genjuro cleanly
   out of his Sanrensatsu everytime but the move is so fast it is hard
   to counter like this.  Also, if Genjuro is still sliding forward you
   can throw him out of the dashing slashes.  Otherwise block it all
   (block in the same direction as the first - but make sure you know 
   when to block in forward position.  This happens when Genjuro uses a
   B or AB Sanrensatsu at close range), then retaliate.

   Toha Kouyokujin (rising purple slash):  Block and retaliate when he
   lands.  Refer to the Combos Section, Special Moves List and Their
   Uses Section on Kamui Ryuse and Apefunchi Kamui Rymuse

Normal Move Counters:
   Standing Far AB slash:  Annu Mutsube - You will have time to get
   Genjuro if you executed your Annu Mutsube as soon as you see the first
   animation frame of his standing far AB (where he lifts his sword up)
   and if you are close enough.  If he just misses you with the move you
   can also B Annu Mutsube to get him.

Human Player Patterns/Strategy:

--------------------------------------------------------------------------

Haohmaru:                                                                

CPU pattern/general:
   - Play turtle.  Watch Haohmaru's move and act on it.
   - If you jump in on CPU Haohmaru he will usually attempt a crouching AB
     slash to counter it.  Therefore, intentionally over-jump and get CPU
     after you land as he is still retracting from the crouching AB.
   - Stay in defensive crouch and wait for Haohmaru to do his attack.  CPU
     Haohmaru will move in and do series of quicker slashes.  And if you
     block them all, he will usually move away a bit and try a standing
     far AB slash.  Recognize this and counter with Annu Mutsube.
   - Sometimes after CPU does a series of slashes, he will back away
     further and then send a Senpuretsuzan.  So when he backs away follow
     him and then counter as he is sending the Senpuretsuzan.
   - CPU Haohmaru will also sometimes stay just outside your attack range
     and do a couple missed slashes or kicks.  Know when he will do these
     and then A Annu Mutsube to counter these missed moves.
   - If Haohmaru jumps in, use crouching CD kicks or air AB to counter.
   - If CPU presses in too closely can do a AB Leyla Mutsube to get out of
     the way.  CPU generally won't retaliate effectively.
   - Make sure you don't try to send Mamahaha away when you are WITHIN
     Haohmaru's standing AB range, or otherwise you will eat a standing AB
     before you have time to summon the bird.

Special move counters:
   Energy Slice (Power Special):  Block it and then Annu Mutsube to get
   him afterwards.

   Kogetsuzan (rising uppercut slash):  Block and retaliate.  Use combo
   (7) listed in the combo section below.  Also, you can Annu Mutsube 
   through to hit Haohmaru out of his Kogetsuzan if his circle slash at 
   the start does not hit you.  This is actually not too hard to do and
   you have quite a good chance of hitting him out.
   
   Resshinzan (leaping somersault slice):  This move has a reasonably
   short lag time after it so you need to retaliate with caution.  Block
   it and Annu Mutsube to retaliate only if Haohmaru is very close to
   you after he execute the move.  Or you can substitute Annu Mutsube with
   either crouching CD kick or crouching AB roll slash.  Also, if you see
   it coming, a quick A Leyla Mutsube as Haohmaru jumps forward in his
   Resshinzan (before he starts slicing) will get him too.

   Sake Attack:  You can Annu Mutsube through it.  Or block it first and
   then Annu Mutsube to retaliate.

   Senpuretsuzan (energy tornado)/False Senpuretsuzan:  If you see
   Haohmaru start his tornado move (no matter whether it's a fake or a
   real one) do your Mamahaha attack straight away.  If it's a real
   tornado it will cancel and if it's a fake Haohmaru will have to take a
   tick of blocked damage or if your falcon comes out fast enough you
   might hit him too!  Nakoruru can also slide through Senpuretsuzans with
   Annu Mutsube right before Senpuretsuzan hits her.  Once again you can
   reflect it with Kamui Rymuse.  Also see Special Move Listing and their
   uses section - Irusuka Yatoro Lise.

   Tempa Fuuzin Zan:  If you see it coming, jump over it (and then
   retaliate after he lands from his final Kogetsuzan).  If there is no
   time to jump, block it all and then retaliate.  Or send Mamahaha to hit
   him if you have time.  Also, as with the Kogetsuzan, Haohmaru can be
   hit out of his Tempa Fuuzin Zan combo by the Annu Mutsube if you can
   slide when his sword is not at the bottom slashing.  I usually go for
   it, especially when I am very low on energy and my opponent is trying
   to finish me off with a Tempa Fuuzin Zan.

Normal Move Counters:
   Standing Far AB slash:  If missed B Annu Mutsube to get him.  If
   blocked at close range (Say within your crouching CD kick range) also
   Annu Mutsube to hit him.

   Standing B slash (poking with sword):  If just missed Annu Mutsube to
   hit him. (Need to be quick)

Human Player Patterns/Strategy:
   (1) Haohmaru's who likes sending out his Senpuretsuzan should be
       punished for their siliness.  At far range, reflect it back.  At
       close range Annu Mutsube through it to hit him.  If he does one
       when you get up and he is close enough to be reached by your 
       crouching CD kick, A Annu Mutsube to hit him after blocking it.

   (2) Against Haohmaru's who knows how to do Tempa Fuzzin Zan, you
       should regularly checks his 'joystick' for the motion of the move
       and if he is attempting it, Annu Mutsube to get him.

   (3) Human Haohmarus also like to use the Resshinzan to get blocked
       energy off you (it takes about 3 ticks).  Many of them also like
       to add a Kogetsuzan after it so that your retaliation move will
       get hit.

   (4) Watch out when Haohmaru runs towards you.  Some of them like to
       run in and then do a Kogetsuzan in front of you to get you as you
       might be trying to hit them.  Well watch out for this and block and
       counter it.  (Or you can Annu Mutsube at the last moment as you see
       them running in)

--------------------------------------------------------------------------

Hanzo Hattori:  

CPU pattern/general:
   - Hanzo will do a roll forward at the start of the round very often.
   - Generally keep him away with standing C kicks as he gets into range.
   - Don't jump in to attack when CPU Hanzo is not doing anything.  CPU
     sometimes will time a perfect Bakuen Ryuu to hit you as you jump in
     CPU Hanzo will also sometimes jump forward and counter you with his
     air AB.
   - Be careful when CPU Hanzo is running towards you, he might pull off a
     Bullhead Blast on you.
   - If he runs in after his fire snake make sure you reflect the fire
     snake with your cape!  It will get him occasionally.
   - Amube Yatoro attack should be used rarely.  CPU Hanzo will sometimes
     time a perfect portal drop from above to get you.

Special move counters:
   Aerial Shuriken:  If the shuriken doesn't hit you, move forward a bit
   and A Annu Mutsube to get him.  Or you can jump forward over the
   shuriken and get Hanzo.  In some situations you can block it and still
   have enough time to nail Hanzo with an Annu Mutsube afterwards provided
   that he is very close.  Or reflect it with Kamui Ryuse?  Slash it in
   half like in SS1?

   Bakuen Ryuu (fire snake):  Reflect it using Kamui Ryuse - especially if
   Hanzo is running towards you after it.  Or jump forward to attack.  You
   can also watch the projectile carefully and Annu Mutsube through when
   the projectile has just leaped from the ground but this is harder to
   do.

   Bullhead Blast (SPD-like throw):   Pray that he doesn't get that off 
   on you!!!!

   Fake Wood/Portal Drop:  If Hanzo does a portal drop from above the
   counter is the same as with Earthquake/Galford.  But after blocking the 
   Portal Drop, instead of using B Annu Mutsube, you shoud move forward a 
   bit and use A Annu Mutsube instead.  The reason is that Hanzo can do a 
   Fake Wood after you nail him with the B Annu Mutsube and get you back 
   because you haven't recovered from your B Annu Mutsube in time to block 
   it.  Annu Mutsube can hit him out of his fake wood attack from below 
   easily.  So if Hanzo does a Fake wood, wait for a split second and go 
   into an A Annu Mutsube which will hit him as he reappears.  Or you can 
   block first and then do the A Annu Mutsube straight after (and you must 
   be do it very quickly straight after and only A Annu Mutsube will work 
   if you want to block first).  If Hanzo does disappear again after
   getting hit by your A Annu Mutsube, do another one and another one 
   until he gives up :-).
   
   Hellfire (Power Special):  Hanzo doesn't seem to have much stun time
   after he executes this move and there is probably no time to
   retaliate after blocking it.  The move however takes a while to come
   out.  If you see that fire of circle on the ground maybe there is
   enough time to Annu Mutsube forward to hit him first?

   Invisibility:  See Galford's invisibility.

   Ninja Multiplier:  Same counter as with Earthquake's Fat Copy.

Normal Move Counters:
   See the same section on Galford for reference.

Human Player Patterns/Strategy:
   (1) See the same section on Galford for reference.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------

Jubei Yagyu:

CPU pattern/general:
   - If trapped in the corner AB Leyla Mutsube to get away is usually OK.
   - Standing C kick him if he gets into range.  If you standing C kick
     CPU often CPU will then switch to a Mikkaku Ratoh as you C kick him
     so watch out for that.
   - Make sure you can distinguish whether he is just running forward or
     is doing Mikkaku Ratoh.  If he is just running forward keep him away
     with standing/crouching C kicks.
   - If you run towards a CPU Jubei, he will usually start a Hasso Happa
     as you get into range.  So utilise this and run towards him and block
     as you get into range when he starts Hasso Happa.  Then retaliate.

Special move counters:
   Hasso Happa (100-sword Strikes):  You can Annu Mutsube through this
   with no problem usually - but I have been hit by it while trying to 
   Annu Mutsube through it too.  Or block it for a while and then Annu
   Mutsube through it as Jubei is about to stop.

   Mikkaku Ratoh (charge forward then rising slash):  Block and then
   retaliate as he lands (combo 7 again!).  It is NOT possible to Annu
   Mutsube to counter it without blocking at close range - you will be
   hit out.  If your Annu Mutsube is already away and sliding I think
   it's OK.

   Suigetsutoh (ground wave projectile):  Reflect using Kamui Ryuse or
   jump over and attack.  Or block it.  You can also Annu Mutsube
   through it I think.

   Yagyu Shingantou (block with one sword/attack with another):  There
   is not much you can do if you are caught in it except for being
   slashed...  But you should try to recognise when Jubei is doing the
   move - when Jubei does the move he is frozen on the spot for about
   nearly 1 second.  CPU will sometimes do this, if you see this and you
   are close Annu Mutsube to hit him as he is frozen on the spot?

   Zetsu Suigetsutoh (Power Special):  See Hanzo's Hell Fire special.

Normal Move Counters:
   recognise these two Jubei's standing slashes - the first one is where
   he just pokes forward with the sword, if he misses you with this you
   will have time to A Annu Mutsube him.  The second one is the one where
   he does a two-hit both of his swords, after blocking the first one
   immediately A Annu Mutsube to hit him.

Human Player Patterns/Strategy:

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
									  
Kuroko:

CPU pattern/general:
   CPU Kuroko Strategy which I worked out while I was in Taiwan playing
   those modified SS2 arcades which replaced a normal Character with
   Kuroko are stated below:
   - Get into a position where you can hit Kuroko if you execute your A
     or B Annu Mutsube and then crouch defending there and wait for Kuroko
     to make a move.
   - If CPU doesn't do anything, do one or two crouching C kicks and
     Kuroko should react to that.  He will do one of the two things:
     * If he react by jumping in, then just walk under and standing close
       B slash him and then send Mamahaha to get one more blocked damage
       straight after.
     * If Kuroko react by sending a projectile to you.  Annu Mutsube
       through it to counter.  Although the projectiles themselves are
       quite fast, Kuroko has a delay before and after all his projectile
       moves which is long enough for you to Annu Mutsube to get him
       provided that you are within the range of your B Annu Mutsube.
   - Use the falcon to get as much blocked damage as you can but don't
     send the falcon out at close range, Kuroko will roll under the falcon
     attack and throw you afterwards.
   - When Kuroko's POW meter is up he will attempt his POW special many
     times so watch out for them.

Special move counters: 
   Koh Ken (single fireball):  Annu Mutsube under it or Kamui Ryuse to
   reflect it.

   Haoh Sho Koh Ken (massive double-sized fireball):  Annu Mutsube under
   it or Kamui Ryuse to reflect it.

   Double Koh Ken:  Annu Mutsube under it works.  I think you cannot 
   reflect both Koh Kens in one go though....

   Mega Smash (cylindrical energy missile):  Kamui Ryuse can reflect it.
   Annu Mutsube goes under it as well.

   Ressen Kyaku (grab and kick for six times):  Make sure you don't get
   grabbed by this...

   Gekihou (Bends and produce giant self-projection):

   Double Senbei Shuriken (throws two cookies, one on top of the other):
   Annu Mutsube under it should work.  Not sure about Kamui Ryuse.

   Kaiser Wave (moon-shaped projectile):  Kamui Ryuse to reflect or Annu
   Mutsube under it?

   Flags of Fury (sends flags out on chain):  Same as Gen-An and
   Nicotine's weapon extension move.

   Mass Slash (swipes flag in downward arc - reflects projectiles):

   Spike Ball (Hurls a black orb covered with barbs):  Annu Mutsube
   under it.  Reflect using Kamui Ryuse?

   Side Splitters:  Not quite sure about this.  Maybe Annu Mutsube
   through both the top half and the bottom half?

   Ryuuko Ranbu (Power Special - charges forward and if hit, begins a
   barrage of attacks):  Block!  Or jump over it.  Kuroko will usually
   do one or two in a row by the way.

   Curse Ball (Power Special):  Haven't seen this.....

Normal Move Counters:

------------------------------------------------------------------------ 

Kyoshiro Senryo:

CPU pattern/general:
   - Use your falcon as much as possible.  CPU Kyoshiro will usually jump
     over them.  Then counter him in air.
   - CPU Kyoshiro will throws his fan as if you send Mamahaha to attack
     and sometimes both of you get hit!
   - If trapped AB Leyla Mutsube to get away.
   - Be careful not to jump in on his power special.
   - If jumping in to attack Kyoshiro make sure you use a kick - you have
     a better chance of hitting Kyoshiro out of his rotating slashes (see
     below)
   - If you are going to counter Kyoshiro jumping in on you with your air
     AB make sure you do it quick as sometimes CPU Kyoshiro will do his
     rotating slashes to hit you.
   - Also don't jump away from close range or CPU will also get you with
     the rotating slashes.
   - Do a few crouching C kicks and sometimes CPU will throw a fan at you,
     Annu Mutsube under to hit him.

Special move counters: 
   Aragotoshi Kyoshiro "Chiniku-no mai" (Power Special):  Block it all
   and get him with an Annu Mutsube afterwards.   Or if Kyoshiro is just 
   spinning there, send Mamahaha to burn him.

   Chi Kemuri Kuruwa (falling rotating slash):  It's safer to block it
   and get Kyoshiro as he lands.  Leyla Mutsube will can counter provided
   that the knife touches Kyoshiro first.  Or otherwise you might trade or
   Kyoshiro will hit you out of Leyla Mutsube.  You can also use crouching
   CD kick to get him as long as he doesn't do this move on top of you.

   Chobi Jishi (flips forward on stick in a fiery spin):  Block and
   then get him with an Annu Mutsube as soon as you are pushed out of
   range of this attack.  Alternatively send the falcon to burn him.

   Fuuretsusen (Fire Fan):  Reflect with Kamui Ryuse or Annu Mutsube
   under it.  You can also slash it in half with Nakoruru's standing
   A slash, and with Nakoruru's standing B slash as well.  See Special
   Moves Listing and Their Uses section on Irusuka Yatoro Lise.

   Kaenkyokubu (Dance of fire):  You can Annu Mutsube through at least
   the A and B Kaenkyokubu.  Not sure about AB one as the flame looks
   larger but it should be OK.  Or you can jump over him and attack from
   the other side.

   Kaiten Kyokubu (rising rotating slash):  Nakoruru's kick can fairly
   easily hit Kyoshiro out of his Vertical Rotating slash if her kick hits
   Kyoshiro from the top and hits approximately in the centre of the 
   spin.  This is why it is wise to jump in mostly with a kick, not a 
   slash.

Human Player Patterns/Strategy:

--------------------------------------------------------------------------

Mizuki:

CPU pattern/general:
   - Don't miss ANY chances of air counters when Mizuki jumps in on you
     (it's about the only time you have an advantage over her), punish
     Mizuki with some nice big air ABs whenever she jumps.
   - Play very defensively.  Stay in defensive crouch and counter
     Mizuki's move accordingly.  If she approaches you to within the
     range of your standing C, crouching C or D kick range then do the
     corresponding move to hit her.
   - Even though it's dangerous, it is worth it trying to jump in a few
     times to try and attack (she doesn't do that perfect-timing with
     projectiles/demon thing if you don't jump in too much)  Sometimes
     you will get her.  Have a quick look to see if the beast, any
     projectile or the energy pool is forming once you jumped in before
     you decide what you going to do when you land from you air attack,
     if nothing is there and your air attack hit then combo her).
   - Mizuki also teleports quite a bit and she usually will appear behind
     you.  She will teleport in the following situations:
     * She sends out a Swine Curse Ball or Mass Confusion Projectile.
       (That's why it's better to jump over these so that you don't have
       to worry about blocking in forward joystick position once Mizuki
       teleported)
     * You attempted either Irusuka Yatoro Lise or Apefunchi Kamui Rymuse.
       (That's why it's not wise at all to use the above moves -
       especially Apefunchi Kamui Rymuse).
   - When Mizuki teleports the safest thing is to jump in the direction
     she has just disappeared from (i.e. forward).
   - Try keep your distance and send Mamahaha to do some blocked damage.
   - Be careful of Mizuki's Power Special Projectile, it travels forward
     and then backwards if you jumped over it.
   - AB Leyla Mutsube out of the corner is NOT a good idea.....  Mizuki
     has too many ways to punish you...
   - The Rush Demon move has a bit of electricity (or lightning) at the
     front of the beast and the Mad Demon move doesn't.

Special move counters: 
   Bitch Slap from Hell (multiple slaps with one hand):  Nothing you can
   do if you are in range except blocking (the slaps doesn't push you
   away either..  Geez..)  Mizuki can do this both standing and crouching.
   I think the Mutsube moves will be hit out by her slaps if she does the
   crouching slaps but if Mizuki does the standing slaps she can be hit
   out of by any attacks that hits low.

   Hell Tempest (power special - although Mizuki doesn't need to be
   POWered up to do this move - a black sphere):  Kamui Ryuse to reflect
   it?  Annu Mutsube Under it?

   Mass Confusion (while & flashing projectile):  Kamui Ryuse can be used
   to 'cancel' the confusion projectile.  I.e. upon contact with the cape
   the confusion projectile disappears.  Annu Mutsube under it?

   Passage through Hell (slides portal under opponent and two hands pull
   opponent in):  Block in defensive crouch and you won't be pulled in.
 
   Rush Demon/Mad Demon:  Like Galford's Rush Dog and Machine Gun Dog, You
   can only Annu Mutsube through the Rush Demon.  I will only recommend
   doing this if Mizuki sends the demon at very close range though (she
   does that often).  But since it's hard to tell which move it is you
   have a 50-50 percent chance - either you slide through and get Mizuki
   along with it, or you get mauled to death by the demon.  I usually go
   for it though....  Not quite sure about using Kamui Ryuse to make
   yourself invulnerable though...

   Swine Curse (a small lightning ball released by her pet demon):  Kamui
   Ryuse doesn't seem to reflect it - I have only tried it a couple of
   times though so I may be wrong.  You can Annu Mutsube under it
   though.  But by the time you realise that it is the swine curse
   coming it's usually too late since Mizuki has already recovered from
   her special move stun time.

Normal Move Counters:
   Standing Wipe with that stick of hers (AB?):  If missed, Annu
   Mutsube.  If blocked, also Annu Mutsube to get her afterwards.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------

Nakoruru: 

CPU pattern/general:
   - Crouch defending on the spot and wait for CPU Nakoruru to make a
     move.
   - Sometimes she won't do anything either so in this case do some
     crouching C kicks to make her do something.  The following is a list
     of things CPU Nakoruru will try:
     * If she jump towards you, walk under and standing close B slash her
       (and then send the falcon to attack for one blocked damage)
     * If she runs towards you or roll towards you, continue your
       crouching C kicks.  (and at all times watch her to see if she is
       going to Annu Mutsube)
     * If she get on the falcon, stop crouching C kicks and wait for her
       to attack, block it and retaliate.
     * If she Annu Mutsubes, block and retaliate.  If she Leyla Mutsubes,
       block and then retaliate.
     * If CPU Nakoruru sends her Mamahaha to attack counter as specified
       below.
   - Don't worry if you are trapped in a corner, just continue to do what
     is said above.
   - NEVER, EVER do a AB Leyla Mutsube to get out of the corner, or you
     will get Annu Mutsubed on the back as you land.

Special move counters: 
   Amube Yatoro (Falcon Summon):  If you see it coming and is close enough
   (i.e. CPU is within your A or B Annu Mutsube range) then A Annu Mutsube
   forward to hit her.  Or when you see Nakoruru starts turning around and
   are about to summon the falcon, jump forward then and attack.  The
   falcon will nearly always miss you this way.  Otherwise block.

   Annu Mutsube:  Block and then do any attack.  Or alternatively, you
   can do your own Annu Mutsube when she starts hers.  The trick is to
   do the move after CPU Nakoruru finishes shouting out "Annu Mutsube".
   Then you do yours.

   Apefunchi Kamui Rymuse (Super Kamui Ryuse):  Block it!  Don't think
   there is much you can do about it.  If you see it coming maybe jump
   over it and attack?

   Falcon Carry:  Jumping up to attack CPU Nakoruru while she is on the
   bird is generally not a good idea.  But sometimes if I judge it 
   correctly I use Leyla Mutsube to get her.

   Irusuka Yatoro Lise (Power Special):  If you are close - Annu
   Mutsube forward to get Nakoruru.  If not, just block it or jump
   over it and attack.

   Kamui Mutsube/Yatoro Poku (attacks off the falcon):  Block and then do
   any crouching attack (I always use crouching AB roll slash).  Yatoro
   Poku has a shorter lag time after Nakoruru lands from the attack so
   make sure you are quick enough.

   Kamui Ryuse:  Block and Annu Mutsube if Nakoruru used a B or AB Kamui
   Ryuse.  Cannot Annu Mutsube through the cape without blocking first I
   think.

   Leyla Mutsube:  If CPU does a Leyla Mutsube that flies over your to
   the other side, start a AB Annu Mutsube after she flies over you (i.e.
   you've turned around) and this will get her on the other side.
   Alternatively you can run after her and retaliate, or send Mamahaha
   after her if you can time it right.

Normal Move Counters:
   Standing Close AB slash:  Annu Mutsube as soon as you see the first
   part of the move.

   Crouching CD kick:  Block and Annu Mutsube.
   Crouching AB Rolling Slash:  Block and throw/retaliate.  Or Annu
   Mutsube through it.

Human Player Patterns/Strategy:

--------------------------------------------------------------------------

Nicotine (Caffeine Nicotine):

CPU pattern/general:
   - Your standing attacks will miss altogether if Nicotine is crouched.
   - CPU Nicotine will also sometimes try running in and then crouching
     CD kick you so make sure you block that.
   - Try to get him to jump and counter him in the air with either the air
     AB slash or Leyla Mutsube.
   - If you AB Leyla Mutsube to get out sometimes Nicotine will send a
     projectile after you so do it sparingly.
   - Be careful if you want to walk under and slash as Nicotine as two air
     moves which will hit opponents on the back (the spiral kick and the
     air AB slash).
   - For some strange reason CPU Nicotine does his 'sneezing' taunts quite
     often.  Make sure when you see it you hit him before his finishes
     sneezing!

Special move counters: 
   Bakusa Jougeki (staff extends via a chain):  the same counter as
   Gen-An's glove extension.

   Confusion:  Just make sure you don't get hit by it!  Block and then
   retaliate.  As soon as the talisman starts falling and change to a
   different colour you can retaliate.
   
   Shikigamireifu, fire (fire demon - run low along ground):  Reflect it
   with Kamui Ryuse, or jump over and attack, or block LOW.  You can
   also Annu Mutsube under this projectile right before it hits you.

   Shikigamireifu, thunder (electric bird - flies at head level):
   Reflect it with Kamui Ryuse, or jump over and attack, or Annu Mutsube
   under it, or crouch and let it fly above you.

   Spiral Kick: Don't think there is anything you can do when he does
   this spiral kick in the air.....  Block and retaliate afterwards with
   an Annu Mutsube.
 
   Summoning Atavakah (Power Special):  Block it for a short while and
   then Annu Mutsube to hit a still-stunned Nicotine.

Normal Move Counters:

Human Player Patterns/Strategy:

--------------------------------------------------------------------------

Sieger (Neinhalt Sieger):

CPU pattern/general:
   - Don't send Mamahaha away too many times in succession (especially if
     you are corner-trapped), CPU will do the Blitz Siege when you are
     about to send the falcon to attack (even though CPU usually miss with
     the Blitz Siege but it is not wise to try sending the falcon too many
     times in succession (except when you have your pattern going - see
     below).
   - Whenever Sieger gets in your standing C kick range kick him!!  You
     can also get offensive and move into range and standing C kick him.
   - If jumping in it is best to use C kick - and kick as early as
     possible since CPU Sieger will usually counter by jumping and doing
     his CD kick belly attack which has very high priority.
   - Don't use Leyla Mutsube to get out of the way or otherwise you will
     get comboed with that backbreaker thing (OUCH!).
   - A very useful pattern for Sieger, send the falcon to attack, Sieger
     will nearly always jumps forward over the falcon and then you standing
     C or D kick him! (you might need to move forward a little bit to get
     into range though.)  Then as he gets kicked back, you send the falcon
     again (he will jump over it again) and repeat.  Can substitute
     standing kicks with a crouching AB roll slash, crouching CD kick or
     you can jump forward and counter with your air AB slash.  Just watch
     out he doesn't do the Blitz Siege move instead of jumping again.  If
     he did the Blitz Siege, counter as specified below.
   - Be careful when Sieger is close to you - CPU may attempt a Wolf Fangen
     throw - this throw has a slightly longer range than your standing C
     kick.
   - Sieger has an air throw also so be careful when jumping in.

Special move counters: 
   Atomic Blast (Power Special):  Block and then retaliate either with
   an Annu Mutsube, or use combo 7.

   Blitz Sieger:  Do either Leyla Mutsube or Annu Mutsube when he is 
   about to hit you.  You will hit him cleanly out of the Blitz Sieger.
   Alternatively you can block it and then Annu Mutsube (or block and
   then use combo 7).  Sometimes CPU will do a Blitz Sieger which will
   land just behind you and you need to make sure that you do the
   Mutsube to go on the other side or you will miss.  Kamui Ryuse or
   crouching AB to counter?

   Finger Flick (reflects projectile):  No concern for Nakoruru - she 
   does not have a projectile!

   Tiger Kopf/launching punch/backbreaker:  CPU will not do the Tiger
   Kopf if it is not going to hit.  But say if he did, block it and
   then Annu Mutsube or just do any slash I guess or throw.  You might
   also be able to Annu Mutsube through to hit him out of the Tiger Kopf?

   Velcan Weinen (turn arm into flamethrower):  I am afraid there is no
   counter for this move.  There is not enough time to Annu Mutsube after
   blocking it.  And you cannot Annu Mutsube through it.  The only thing
   is if you can see it coming (it takes a while to start) then you can
   probably Annu Mutsube to hit him before the arm starts firing.  Or to
   be sure when you see it coming, jump and attack from the air.

   Wolf Fangen (arm extends along ground and grabs):  If you stay in
   defensive crouch Sieger's Wolf Fangen cannot grab you.  Sometimes you 
   can retaliate with an A Annu Mutsube - but this depends on how close
   Sieger attempted the throw.  So the safest thing to do is to send 
   Mamahaha to take a tick of damamge after you block it low.

Normal Move Counters:

Human Player Patterns/Strategy:
   (1) Sieger players like to use that big cannon of theirs to blast you
       whenever you come into range.  So if you get into range and see
       them preparing for that big blast - jump over them.

   (2) Many Sieger players also like to get in close and then tag you
       with a crouching D kick into the Velcan Weinen.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------

Ukyo Tachibana:

CPU pattern/general:
   - When you are knocked down, CPU Ukyo will sometimes do his apple
     slices as you get up, counter accordingly as stated below.
   - Do AB Leyla Mutsube to get out of the way if CPU Ukyo gets too close.
     He usually won't do any effective retaliation after he blocks it.
   - If Ukyo moves in too close don't miss any crouching attacks or CPU
     will do a perfectly-timed SSS firebird to get you.
   - Stay in defensive crouch and watch for Ukyo's moves.  If he moves too
     close push him away with standing C kicks or crouching C or D kicks.
   - Use the falcon to do some blocked damage.
   - A pattern here for you:  if Ukyo blocks your first B Mamahaha attack,
     do another one immediately after which CPU Ukyo will almost always
     jump over but he will be in perfect distance for you to crouch CD
     kick him out of the sky.
   - If CPU Ukyo jumps, you must be careful, you can usually counter with
     a jumping air AB provided you hit him out very early in his jump.
     Crouching CD kick also does NOT work as an air counter on Ukyo if
     he jumps in and does a late firebird.
   - Also don't hop back at close range or CPU Ukyo will sometimes do the
     spirit slide to hit you as you hop back.

Special move counters: 
   Hiken Sasame Yuki (apple splice):  If you see Ukyo toss an apple and
   you are close enough to reach him with an Annu Mutsube BEFORE he starts
   slicing then get him with an Annu Mutsube.  Or otherwise wait until he
   is about to finish with his apple slicing (start the Annu Mutsube after
   he slices down for the third time) and then Annu Mutsube to get him.
   It seems not possible to jump in and attack when he is slicing the
   apple now so if you really want to jump in - jump over him and attack.
   DO NOT do the Annu Mutsube while he is still doing the apple slice -
   you can slide past if you go through only if his sword is not slashing
   down but it is very hard to time.  Sometimes CPU will do this special
   move as you get up.  If CPU does this move very close to you as you get
   up, you can also usually throw him out of the move (since CPU usually
   throws out the apple too late and hence you will have time).

   Hiken Tsubame Gaeshi (Swallow Swipe firebird - air or ground):  If Ukyo
   jumps in and does a Swallow Swipe firebird where his sword touched
   you as you block it, Ukyo then will most likely bounce back.  Execute
   Annu Mutsube straight away after blocking to hit him as he lands.  If 
   Ukyo just jumps straight up and does the Swallow Swipe firebird, 
   quickly go into Annu Mutsube to hit him as he lands from the move (the 
   firebird won't get you provided that Ukyo doesn't do it in the last 
   minute befor he lands).  Just make sure you will reach him in time.  
   As for the ground ones, if he hops back and do a firebird, you can only
   block it or jump over it I guess.  You CANNOT Annu Mutsube through
   those hop-back ground firebirds!  Also, you can always try and reflect
   those firebirds with Kamui Ryuse if you can time it well.

   Tsubame Roku Ren (Power Special):  Block it, and as Ukyo is bouncing
   back do an Annu Mutsube to get him as he lands.

   Zanzou Fumikomi Giri (Spirit Slide):  Block and retaliate with any
   attack?  This move has a very short recovery time though.  Annu 
   Mutsube will counter this move but you must be quick.

Normal Move Counters:
   Standing Far AB slash:  If Ukyo misses, Annu Mutsube straight away to
   get him.

   Crouching AB slash:  Block and Annu Mutsube, or just Annu Mutsube if
   missed.

Human Player Patterns/Strategy:
   (1) Constant bombardment of SSS firebirds:  Against Ukyos who just
       jumps up and down and does his firebirds all day.  Against these
       human Ukyos you should try and stay close all the time.  When he
       jumps and does a firebird you should jump forward over it if
       after you jump over you are not in range of his standing B or AB
       slash.  Or you can block it and then run forward a bit.  If you get
       close enough and he does a firebird, then jump over and do a air D
       kick as you land.  Or you can roll or duck under the firebirds
       and then move forward.  Ground SSS firebirds are much more of a
       nuisance.  Just make sure you get in close as quickly as possible
       as good Ukyos won't attempt a SSS firebird at close range and so
       they will have to use some other attacks.  When reflecting human
       SSS firebirds make sure you be careful and only do it either at
       close range or very far away.  As at medium distance, if you
       reflect a late Ukyo SSS firebird, it will be reflected under ground
       but Ukyo will have time to get you with a spirit slide while you
       are still recovering from the stun time of Kamui Ryuse.  If your
       POW meter is up, and human Ukyo does a firebird quickly do your
       POW special to get Ukyo!

   (2) Spirit slide then throw/A slash pattern:  After blocking the
       spirit slide you should immediately push forward to throw if Ukyo
       is close enough.  Or if he is a bit further and he uses spirit
       slide and then slash tactic, do an Annu Mutsube after blocking
       the spirit slide.  Or if you see the spirit slide coming, just
       Annu Mutsube to slash him out of the move.

   (3) SSS firebird and then spirit slide pattern

--------------------------------------------------------------------------

Wan-Fu:

CPU pattern/general:
   - When trapped in the corner, AB Leyla Mutsube to escape is not a good
     idea since CPU Wan-Fu will sometimes decide to do a standing AB slash
     which will get you as you land on the other side (2-hit as well!)
   - Standing C kicks are very useful in keeping big slow Wan-Fu away from
     you.  But beware of that spinning fire column move he does on the
     ground - he will do it occasionally if you tap on your C buttons too
     many times.
   - Don't stay trapped in the corner for too long, and don't jump back
     against the wall when you are trapped in the corner cause Wan-Fu will
     just step forward and then do his Confucious Slash to hit you out of
     the air...
   - Pray that CPU does the Benpatsu Attack.....
   - When trapped in the corner, CPU Wan-Fu likes to jump in with a butt
     drop (air C?) and then throw you afterwards so watch out.

Special move counters: 
   Benpatsu Attack (Exploding Confucious - drains health to power up the
   POW meter);  LET HIM!!!  You cannot Mutsube to hit him while he is
   pounding his head on the column (I think).  Send Mamahaha to burn him
   when you see him do this move.

   Confucious Slash (rising flame pillar):  Block and retaliate (combo 7).

   Confucious Swipe (sweep with column):  Block and then retaliate.  Annu
   Mutsube does NOT go under it when the column is at its lowest swing
   arc.  Note that Wan-Fu is vulnerable whenever his back is towards you
   when he sweeps with the column so you might have time to do a quick
   A/B slash or C/D kick to hit him out of the move if he is close and his
   back is facing you.  Or if you time your Annu Mutsube well you can get
   him as his column goes past it's lowest point.

   New Confucious Thunder Bomb (leap and throw weapon):  If you see it
   coming,  then Annu Mutsube before the Column comes down and you should
   nail Wan-Fu as he lands.  Otherwise block!  Be careful of Wan-Fu
   running in to throw you if you blocked.  AB Leyla Mutsube away after
   you block the fire column generally works to get away from a running
   in Wan-Fu and also sometimes preventing him from getting his column
   back.  You also get a tick of blocked damage....

   Shin Kikou Dai Bakuten (Power Special):  Same as with New Confucious
   Thunder Bomb.

Normal Move Counters:
   Standing far AB:  Block it and immediately do either B/AB Annu
   Mutsube, crouching B or AB slash or crouching CD kick.  You will hit
   him before he has time to start retracting from the attack.
