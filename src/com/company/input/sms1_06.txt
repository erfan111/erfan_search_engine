With the 8-bit machines joining the ranks of the "classics", I figured it
was about time that the SMS received its own FAQ list.

*** 1) What _is_ the SMS, and if it was such a great system, why didn't it
gain popularity? ***  

The SMS (Sega Master System) was Sega's answer to Nintendo's 8-bit NES
(Nintendo Entertainment System).  As for its lack of popularity:  many
reasons, I suppose, but here are those that are considered the most
significant:

- The Nintendo Entertainment System came first.  With it, Nintendo's third
party policy (at the time, if you programmed for the Big N, you programmed
for the Big N only).  Thus, Sega suffered.

- Poor management by Tonka, who handled the SMS here in the states.  Sega
took over after the release of the Genesis, at which time, there was a
noticeable commitment to quality software, even though it contained mostly
downscaled 16-bit titles.

- Poor software.  I admit, the SMS sported some retched stuff with its
introduction, with most of it leaning toward the sports/action spectrum
(i.e. didn't appeal to the entire crowd).

While the system failed in the U.S., it is currently the strongest 8-bit
machine in the U.K. (just now feeling the pinch of the 16-bit systems). 
Software support is still strong overseas.

*** 3)  What variations of the SMS are available? ***

THE ORIGINAL MODEL (SMS I): a large, tech-looking system measuring 14 3/8 W
- 6 5/8 D - 2 3/4 H, with sharp corners (unlike the Genesis or SMS II) and
black plastic casing.  In comparison, the NES looks like a Cessna
single-engine compared to the SMS' SR-71 design.  After a one inch base,
the machine is formed upward and inward to form the cartridge slot plateau.
Rather snazzy...

   ________________
  /________________\      ORIGINAL MODEL (SMS I)          
 |__________________|   Nondescriptive front view


When released, SMS I pack-ins included (product # shown): 

3000      Hang On/Safari Hunt ("Master" package; including base unit, 2
          controllers, combo cart, light phaser, and hook-ups; original
          retail price of approx. $200 (I paid $230 for mine <Grin>))

3005      Hang On/Astro Warrior ("Base" package; including base unit, 2
          controllers (maybe only 1?), combo cart, and hook-ups; original
          retail of approx. $120)  

3001      Missile Defense 3-D ("SegaScope" package; including base unit, 2
          controllers, cart, 3-D Glasses, light phaser and hook-ups;
          original retail price of approx. $???)  

Unlike the NES, the SMS had an instructional screen that would appear if
you turned on your system without having a cart or card inserted.  Later
on, Sega switched to built-in software, which would automatically load if
you turned on your machine without a game present.  This resulted in 3
(possibly 4) different built-in variations (probably with reduced retail
prices).  They are:

#1.  Hang On/Safari Hunt
#2.  Missile Defense 3-D
#3.  Hang On/Astro Warrior (exist?  I have yet to encounter one)
#4.  Hang On

THE SMS II: the "2nd generation" SMS (comparable to the Atari 2600 Jr.
and newly remodeled NES), measuring _ x _ x _.  Very much the opposite of
the original model, the SMS II looks similar to the newly remodeled 16-bit
Genesis system.  Smooth curves, rounded corners, variable degrees of black
and gray colored plastic, plus an enlarged, white Pause button for those
"dive for the system" type of action games.  As an incentitive, Sega
included Alex Kidd in Miracle World as a built-in freebie, and offered the
package with one controller and hook-ups.  Unlike the SMS I however, the
SMS II has no card port, resulting in the inability to play card based
games and 3-D carts (since the 3-D glasses use the card slot).  The SMS
II's cart slot is of a different design than the original; instead of
swinging, hinged doors, the SMS II operates by a sliding mechanism.  Also
note that the SMS II lacks the opening logo music tune, and the text
"Master System", when powered up.  Nor does it possess a reset button,
power-on light, A/V output, and extension port (all of these features were
removed in order to drop the price of manufacture).

Original retail price:  approx. $50.

For those interested in playing SMS games, but who don't want to shell out
the cash for the system, you should check out the "puesdo-SMS" systems:
Power Base Converter (SMS to Genesis adapter) and Master Gear (SMS to Game
Gear adapter).

In the U.K., players were given the same pack-ins as those in the states --
concerning the original "Sega Master System."  The U.K. was also blessed
with the "Sega Master System Plus" (unfortunately, I have no idea what the
"Plus" entails).  Later, with the "Sega Master System II", Sonic the
Hedgehog (cart) soon accompanied Alex Kidd in Miracle World (built in) as a
pack-in, but then later replaced Alex as the built in feature.

In Japan (the birth place of the Sega Master System), the "SG-1000" (early
Japanese SMS) came and went pretty quickly.  Later, the "Sega Mark III"
appeared, which is similar to the U.S. SMS unit, except for some added FM
chips.  Also available in Japan was the "Sega Master System" (which
featured built-in 3-D hardware) and from Samsung came the "Gamboy" (a
licensed Master System with FM sound).  I have no idea what pack-ins or
built-in games may have come with these systems.         

*** 4)  Where can I find SMS software and hardware? ***

Best bet:  yard and garage sales, flea markets, and pawn shops.  'Course,
rec.games.video.marketplace wouldn't be a bad place to start.  :)

If you'd like to avoid used items, Sega still offers SMS games,
accessories, and base units.  1-800-USA-SEGA (voice).

Telegames USA offers accessories and U.K.-imported software, but they have
a reputation for being both expensive and slow in filling orders.  You can
request a catalog and other information:  (214) 227-7694 (voice).

Tenex Computer Express has some compatible controllers available in their
Commodore/Amiga catalog; the Beeshu Ultimate Superstick (joystick with
turbofire), Kraft Systems TripleTrack (rollerball), and Beeshu Zoomer
Control Yoke (flight simulator controller with turbofire).  They can be
contacted at:  1-800-PROMPT-1 (voice).

If you're in serious need of SMS controllers, you should look to see what
games in your collection are compatible with the standard Genesis 3-button
and 6-button joypads.  You'll find that many games do function properly. 
Following is a list of games that _are not_ compatible with Genesis pads
(this is very much incomplete - please let me know of possible additions):

Shanghai
Wonderboy in Monsterland

Following is a list of U.S.A. released software.  Originally created by
Greg Alt (galt@asylum.cs.utah.edu), I've modified it a bit by adding my own
comments and alphabetizing the entries.  This is a finite listing, as Sega
has dropped software support for the SMS in the states.

                    capable.  Examples:  Time Soldiers [SMS, arcade?],
                    Ikari Warriors [NES]   
action =            side scrolling, sideview action platform.  Examples:
                    Shinobi [SMS, NES, arcade], Mega Man [NES, SNES,
                    Gameboy, Genesis]
sports =            fitting into a sports category.  Will be defined in
                    listing.
Action/adventure =  action game with adventure-like overtones.  Unless
                    stated, action-adventure games are sideview.  Examples:
                    Legend of Zelda [NES], Wonderboy in Monsterland [SMS]  
Full RPG (FRPG)  =  complete role playing game set-up, with experience
                    point system.  Examples:  Phantasy Star [SMS], Final
                    Fantasy [NES]

overhead =          birds eye view of the gameplay area.  Usually provides
                    scrolling in all four compass directions, or vertical
                    only. Example:  Legend of Zelda [NES], Golden Axe
                    Warrior, Astro Warrior [SMS]
sideview =          view of the gameplay area while oriented on the same
                    plane.  Usually provides horizontal scrolling only. 
                    Example:  Altered Beast [SMS, Genesis, arcade]
1st person =        game in which the viewpoint is from directly behind the
                    player controlled object.  Examples:  Space Harrier
                    [SMS, Turbografx-16, arcade, Game Gear], Afterburner
                    [SMS, NES, arcade]
Full 1st person =   game in which the viewpoint is from the "inside" of the

UPDATE:  Could SMS carts be "bilingual?"  Galen Komatsu
(gkomatsu@uhunix.uhcc.hawaii.edu) comments that his version of World Grand
Prix sports a title screen stating "The Circuit" when ran thru his Power
Base Converter via his Megadrive (Japanese Genesis).  Question is:  Is this
common of all World Grand Prix (i.e. the title screen dissimilarity) carts
even when played on "full" U.S. systems, or could it be a possible
English/Japanese ROM, in much the same way as Sega Genesis carts?   

Note that Bomber Raid is packaged with a black box instead of the usual
white.  I believe this signifies that the game was distributed by
Activision (the 3rd party responsible for Bomber Raid).

Note that Ghostbusters seems to have been distributed by both Sega (in
typical white packaging) and Activision (in black packaging).  The black
packaging may be limited to Puerto Rico, where it was reported.  Info?  

Note that the Canadian version of Captain Silver contains extra material,
as implied by a Sega of America help sheet (extra levels and boss
characters).  Why these were deleted from the U.S. version is not
known.  I also have no idea if the U.K. version contains the extra
material, or if other Canadian games have major dissimilarities.

Note that Alex Kidd in Miracle World is available in THREE slightly varied
versions:  one with rice balls, one with hamburgers, and one with root
beer.  (The ball/hamburger/beer is the item Alex is eating/drinking on the
intermission map screen.)  It appears that the root beer version is limited
to cart only, although cart versions with the rice ball exist.  The
hamburger version has been found in the SMS II only (thus far).  I have no
idea how rare the root beer or hamburger versions of AKIMW are.  Note that
the root beer cart was reported in Puerto Rico, and the hamburger
variation in Indiana.  No actual gameplay differences have been reported.

Note that Power Strike appears to have been packaged in two ways:  black &
white box, and color box.  See question #18 for more information.

And for those who are unaware, SMS games were sold in much the same
way as 16-bit Genesis carts: a box resembling a VCR tape case, with the
instructions, game, and any pamphlets/advertisements held on the inside
walls.  The major factor between the 8-bit and 16-bit packaging is the
color; SMS boxes are white with a checkered pattern - in effect, the
negative of early Genesis packaging.  Card boxes are thinner than those for
carts.

Also, Absolute Entertainment did sign on as a 3rd party, but during the
SMS' death, handed over their R.C. Grand Prix to Sesmic, who (I suppose)
turned it over to Activision.  AE canceled James Bond 007 for a U.S. SMS
release.  These are the only two games I'm aware of (concerning AE's
involvement with the SMS).

Most games that were released in a card format in the U.S. were also
released as carts in the U.K. (in conjunction with the SMS II).

A few folks have mentioned that the card F-16 Fighting Falcon does not work
with the Power Base Converter (SMS -> Genesis adapter).

*** 7)  What accessories are available for the SMS? ***

Here are those offered by Sega.  Other companies also developed various
peripherials, including joypads, joysticks, and light guns.  In Europe,
Sega released a "Handle Controller", and in Japan, a BASIC program language
attachment, keyboard, and light pen.  Also available in Europe is the Pro
Action Replay (a cheat code device similar to the Game Genie).

                                        The Control Stick was a joystick
                                        designed for right handed control,

3045           Rapid Fire Unit          From Brett Carver:  A small device
                                        that is inserted between a
                                        two-button controller and the game
                                        system.  It provides an auto-repeat
                                        capability for the control buttons
                                        which saves a lot of wear-and-tear
                                        on fingers for games like
                                        Astro-Warrier.  The auto-repeat
                                        could be turned on for each button
                                        independently.

                                        with SMS systems.  Resembling the
                                        1st generation NES pads, the
                                        Control Pad was equipped with 3
                                        buttons in its early years, with
                                        the extra sitting in the center of
                                        the thumb section.  Later pads
                                        sported mini-joysticks
                                        (thumbsticks) which could be
                                        inserted into the center of the
                                        thumbpad once the central button
                                        cap was removed.  Later pads had
                                        the entire central button idea
                                        removed.

                                        From Matthew Kasdorf:    
                                        SMS Control Pad Information:
                                        -female plug on end view: 5 4 3 2 1
                                                                   9 8 7 6

*** 8)  I've heard about a built in, hidden game?  What gives? ***

The original model of the SMS has a built in, code accessible maze game;
your goal is to guide a small snail through a series of different levels. 
Not much play value, but it's a nice extra to have.

If you own an original model SMS without a built in game...
Turn on your SMS and wait for the instruction screen to appear.  With
controller 1, press up and hold buttons 1 and 2.

If you own an original model SMS with a built in game...
First, hold down the sequence given above.  While holding, turn the machine
on and wait.

The SMS II does not have the snail maze game.

*** 9)  Can I play Game Gear games on my SMS? ***

Someone once mentioned that a pre-Christmas '92 issue of VG&CE contained a
mailorder ad offering a GG to SMS adapter, but my VG&CE collection is
incomplete, and I haven't been able to confirm its existence.  Any
information is welcome.

*** 10)  Can I play SMS games on the 16-bit Genesis? ***

With the aid of a device called the Power Base Converter, it's possible to
play all (*) SMS games (including 3-D, light phaser, and cards) on the
original model Genesis.  The converter retails for $40-50, but can be found
discounted for as low as $15.  Note that a Power Base Converter for the
Genesis II is available in Europe only.    

* It has been reported that the card F-16 Fighting Falcon does not work on
the Power Base Converter.  The title screen and music begin as usual, but
pushing the Start button blanks out the screen, although the sound effects
and pause button are unaffected.

*** 11)  Can I play SMS games on the Game Gear? ***

Yes.  A few adapters exist, with Sega's own being the "Master Gear."  Only
cartridges can be used, and those requiring special accessories or a second
controller won't function properly.  Another problem:  small text and
objects become difficult to make out on the GG.  UPDATE:  It seems that 
4-meg SMS carts have minor (i.e. graphics problems) difficulties when used
in a SMS->GG converter.  (This is due to Game Gear limitations, and not the
converter itself.) 

*** 12) Is U.K. SMS software compatible with the U.S. unit? ***

Yes.  Although folks may be wondering about PAL and NTSC electrical
definitions, there appears to be no problems playing U.K. games.

*** 13) Is Japanese SMS software compatible with the U.S. unit? ***

I haven't had anyone confirm the fact, but from what I've seen, I think it
is possible to play Japanese SMS software (from all Japanese system
variations) on U.S. hardware.  Cart ports appear the same in size and
design, and electrical definitions are similar.

*** 14) Can I play SMS 3-D games without the 3-D glasses? ***

A few games do have special codes or options to disable the 3-D feature,
and they're listed below.  If anyone knows of any other 3-D games with a
2-D option, please let me know.

Zaxxon 3-D:  Press pause at the title screen to bring up an option menu. 
Simple enough.  :)

Poseiden Wars 3-D:  Plug a control pad into the 2nd port.  With this
controller, press button #1.

Space Harrier 3-D:  Play the game in 3-D until you reach the first boss. 
Let him kill you.  If you obtained a high enough score, you'll get an
initials input screen after the Game Over message.  With the 2nd
controller, and holding button #1, enter T-H-R-E-E.  Note that the word
will not be displayed on the screen.

*** 15) Where can I find SMS cheats, tips, and strategy guides? ***

The SMS Cheat Tips Compilation is under way.  Check out the header of this
FAQ for more info.

Check out the Game Gear FAQ for a nice listing of common SMS
cheats.  Available via FTP: ftp.netcom.com, directory /pub/vi/vidgames/faqs,
file gamegear.faq

Also check out early issues of Electronic Gaming Monthly, Video Games &
Computer Entertainment, and GamePro.

Jeff Rovin published a nice (though not free of errors) listing of cheats
and short strategy guides in his "How To Win At Sega & Genesis Games"; the
fourth paperback in a series of video game strategy books.  Search your
local bookstore -- they should have a copy on hand.  Published by St.
Martin's Paperbacks.

Help sheets are available from Sega of America, although you'll be limited
to 3 games per request.  Check out the U.S.A. software list (question 5)
for a listing of games with help sheets available. 

*** 16) Is there a way to move the SMS pause button from the system to a
controller? ***

Following is a hack reprinted from "SMS Unlimited #1."  It's a bit messy,
but it'll work.
 
DISCLAIMER:  Neither Jeremy Statz, Jeff Bogumil, nor "SMS  Unlimited" are
responsible for any damages or losses made, be they to the system,
controller, materials, or individual, if this modification procedure is
performed. 

              HOW TO GIVE YOUR SMS CONTROLLER A PAUSE BUTTON 
 
                        Procedure by Jeremy Statz  
                         Written by Jeff Bogumil 
 
[The following hack was submitted by Jeremy Statz, who performed the
original procedure on his Power Base Converter.  I've rewritten the concept
to make it more easily readable, and given notes for SMS I owners.  I HAVE
NOT given instructions for the SMS II, but I would guess that only some
minor changes, if any, would need to be made - ed.] 
 
MATERIALS NEEDED: 
 
"Wand" soldering iron 
Solder 
VERY small clippers 
Liquid Latex 
Plastic Cement  
Insulated wire connectors, set of 4  
4 pieces of wire, each approx. 1 foot in length  
4 pieces of wire, each approx. 7 feet in length  
Small pair of needle nose pliers (for SMS owners) 
Small Phillips screwdriver 
Electrical tape 
 
NOTE:  It's recommended that you color code the wires together 
(i.e. a red 1 footer with a red 7 footer, etc...) 
 
STEP 1:  Using a phillips screwdriver, remove the top black 
casing from your PBC (or SMS).  The pause button should be easily seen. 
(SMS owners will have to use the screwdriver and pliers to remove a large
metal shield before they can proceed.) 
 
STEP 2:  Take the clippers and VERY CAREFULLY snip the 4 
attachment prongs of the pause button.  Remove it. 
 
STEP 3:  Solder each wire (7 feet long) to each prong of the pause button.
 
STEP 4:  Solder each wire (1 foot long) to the appropriate points on the
PBC (or SMS).  Be sure to match up the color codes with their respective
connections (i.e. The upper left pause button prong should be matched with
the upper left location on the system).  
 
STEP 5:  Carefully work the 4 wires (attached to the system) through the
pause button port of the cover (and shielding, for SMS owners).  Do not
replace the covers yet (i.e Do not replace the screws). 
          
STEP 6:  Take the wire connectors (it really doesn't matter what type they
are, as long as they are insulated) and solder them to their appropriate
wires.  
 
STEP 7:  After all the solder has dried, and all the connections have been
checked for sturdiness, place liquid latex over any exposed wires to
prevent electric shock and/or corrosion. 
 
STEP 8:  Replace all the wires and shields. 
 
STEP 9:  Use plastic cement to glue the pause button to a comfortable and
reachable spot (during gameplay) on your favorite SMS controller. 
          
STEP 10:  To clean up the wire pollution, you may want to tape the four
wires together with electrical tape.

END OF PROCEDURE

*** 17)  Did SMS software really start the "meg" thing? ***

I won't claim that the SMS was the first home video game system to break
the 1-megabit barrier, but yes, SMS carts were the first to use the term
"mega" as a means of sales promotion.  Later, Sega picked up "meg" when
promoting their 16-bit Genesis game, Strider.  You'll find "mega" plastered
on boxes and labels of certain SMS titles. 

*** 18)  I've heard about a "limited edition" SMS game.  Info? ***

The overhead, vertical shooter called Power Strike was promoted by Sega as
a limited edition game, offered through their user-base club.  Later, it
popped up in decent quantities in various toy store chains.  The game's
packaging is in black and white; screen shots and all (giving the
appearance of a counterfeited item).  Power Strike is known as Aleste in
Japan.  NOTE:  It has been reported that Power Strike is also avaiable in
a full color packaging.  More info, anyone?

*** 19)  What would I find if I compared the SMS and Game Gear? ***

The Game Gear is actually a slightly scaled down SMS, with its own play
screen (of course) and controller features built into the portable unit. 
The systems are extremely similar:  it's known that the Master Gear (SMS to
GG adapter) is only a vehicle which connects the SMS cart and GG port pins,
with little or no electronics used in the process.  This being the case,
I've printed the following information in the hopes that some technical
maven out there can use these statistics in order to create a GG to SMS
adapter (no matter the cost <Grin>).  Thanks to Matthew Kasdorf for
providing all this stuff.

*** 20) The instruction manual says <such and such>, but the game does/says
<such and such>.  Info? ***

Following is a list of instruction manual corrections:

CAPTAIN SILVER:  There are only four rounds and three bosses -- the Joker,
the first Pirate, and Captain Silver.

GOLVELLIUS:  The Ring of Invisibility - as mentioned in the game - is
actually a Ring of Invincibility.

Jaspa          Crawky
Heidi          Haidee

GREAT BASEBALL:  You are unable to select your catchers.

PSYCHO FOX:  Typo correction - the words "stages" (on pg. 20 and 21) should
read as "rounds."

SPACE HARRIER 3-D:  The correct continue code is - when you die, press Up,
then buttons 2, 1, 2, 1, 1, on controller #1.

SPELLCASTER:  To use a spell, continously press the joypad Up and Down,
while holding the fire button down.

TIME SOLDIERS:  Once the two continues are used, the game ends.  This
corrects the manual's statement that if there are two players playing at
the same time, a player will always be revived, as long as the other player
remains alive.

ZILLION:  Don't enter the suicide code in room C-4 as instructed by the
instruction manual.  Such kidders, Sega...

ZAXXON 3-D:  The W capsule lets you access the different weapons.  The E
capsule lets you receive an extra ship.
