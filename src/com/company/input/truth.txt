THE TRUTH ABOUT THE NEW COPIERS !!!
*
THE SUPER WILD CART DON'T AND WILL NEVER COPY THE DSP GAMES. THE PROJECT IS
ABANDONNED AS THE COST OF DEVELOPMENT WAS TOO HIGH FOR PLAYING 5 GAMES. THE
SUPER WILD CART WILL GO OUT WITH AN INTEGRATED DRIVE, BUT WITHOUT DSP COPY
CAPABILITIES. CONCERNING THE FIGHTER PRO, THIS IS A COPY OF THE MAGICOM OF
A SMALL COMPANY WHO PRETENDS HE CAN OVERCOME THIS DSP COPY PROBLEM. IN FACT
THEY BUY ORIGINAL CARTRIDGES, TAKE THE DSP OUT AND MAKE THEIR "DSP CARD".
I CAN DO IT MYSELF, BUT THE PRICE IS TOO HIGH, BECAUSE NOBODY BUT NINTENDO
CAN ASSUME THE PRICE OF DEVELOPMENT FOR THE DSP. FOR THE OTHER HAND,
NINTENDO DON'T WANT TO CONTINUE TO PRODUCE GAMES WITH DSP, AS THEY ALREADY
SPENT 5 MILLIONS DOLLARS TO PRODUCE THEIR CARTRIDGES WITH DSP. THEY ALREADY
HAVE THE DSP2, AND ARE LOOKING FOR DSP3. SO EVEN THE FIGHTER WILL BE
UNUSABLE IN SOME MONTHS. SO IF YOU WANT TO PLAY THE DSP GAMES, BUY THEM.
IT WILL BE CHEAPER. REMEMBER THAT MAGICOM AND SUPERCOM PRO II ARE COPYING
THE 98 % OF THE GAMES, AND THAT IS A RECORD IN THE HISTORY.
TRY TO FIND A HARDCOPIER WITH THIS AMONT OF SUCCESS AT THIS PRICE !!!
I HOPE NOW YOU UNDERSTAND THE SITUATION.
