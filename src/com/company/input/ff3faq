   I would like to thank King Kung and JonN2000 for giving me so much to do
with the game, Final Fantasy Three! I've never done so much hard work to fine
tune a FAQ to perfection, but I think I have finally come up with the best
compilation of a FAQ for FF3. If not, then King King or JonN2000, please,
be my guest to release another FAQ! I have included a new monster list that
is leaps and bounds over the former one, including everything from the gold
you get at the end of a battle to the amount of EXP you gain! All of this
is all in credit to the wonder of wonders, Seth Hardy!

For all of you out there, here is a little history of the FF3 FAQ:

Version 1.0a - (By JonN2000)  The first FF3 FAQ ever!

Version 1.0b - (By King Kung) Including a Walkthrough and more, this FAQ was
                              in my opinion better organized and clearer than
                              Jon's FAQ.

Version 2.0 - (By Wizard 201) Packed with info, stats for weapons, monster 
                              list, GG codes, and other misc. info!

Version 3.0 - (By King Kung)  Everything from Version 2.0 and more including
                              different strategies with weapons and magic.

Version 4.0 - (By Wizard 201, JonN2000 and King Kung)  
                              Everything in Version 3.0 plus interviews
                              with Square representitives, MORE misc. info
                              on desperation moves, Lore & Rage Lists, 
                              SKetch/Control lists, 'The Best for FF3',
                              greatly improved monster list and more 
                              GG codes!

Believe me people, this has to be the best compilation ever created!
Until the next version, of course!

By King Kung
Edited by Wizard 201

                 ***THE WORLD OF BALANCE WALKTHROUGH***


(1)  The Story Begins! 
        
        As Terra, Vicks, and Wedge, head north through Narshe. You will 
fight guards along the way, which are easily defeated by the Fire Beam. If 
you get severely injured, use the Heal Force, Tonic, or Terra's Cure1 spell. 
Remember to save at the first opportunity, because you don't want to repeat 
the intro again! During the battle with Whelk, remember not to use the Bolt 
Beam (he fights back if you do), and to avoid hitting the shell. Have Terra 
use TekMissels, while the other two shoot the Fire Beam. When the creature 
goes back into its shell, use the Heal Force to get back HP, or wait until he 
comes out. Continue until it dies. The frozen Esper will kill Wedge and 
Vicks. When you wake up, explore the house's clock, as it holds a valuable 
Elixir. Then head out the back door. There's only one way through the cave, 
so follow it. Be sure to save your game and open up the treasure chests along 
the way. Eventually the guards will corner you, and you'll fall through the 
floor. Enjoy the little cinema scene! 
        
        Never fear, Locke's here! He'll come to Terra's rescue, with the help 
of those ever cute Moogles. In the group battle, switch to the group that has 
Mog in it (no, he doesn't join you right now). When he learns his first 
dance, use it to waste the other enemies (including the Marshall at the end). 
Upon completion, Locke will bring Terra out of the cave, and through a secret 
passage that will be important later. From there, leave the town and save 
your game. Head straight for Figaro Castle. Upon arrival, be sure to visit 
the item and tool shops. There you should buy plenty of Tonic and the three 
tools for Edgar. Talk to Edgar and explore the castle. An old guy will tell 
you about Edgar's brother, Sabin. Cinema scene! When Kefka storms the 
castle, you'll escape on Chocobos. Fight the M-TekArmors that Kefka sends at 
you, using Edgar's AutoCrossbow and Terra's Fire spell. Ride to Figaro Cave 
(it's to the south-east), and save your game. Enter the cave and be sure 
that you visit the recovery spring (with the turtle in it). Don't worry about 
the passage on the other side, you'll reach that later. Continue through 
a doorway, and head to your left. Go upstairs and open the treasure chest. 
Head back down, then to your right, and down. Pick up the treasure chest in 
the alcove to your right. Before going up those stairs, go to your left and 
find the treasure chest. Then go back to the stairs, go up, head downwards, 
and go down those stairs. Exit the cave and head south-east to South Figaro. 
Save your game outside, then enter. Go meet Shadow (you'll meet again after 
the river ride), then explore the town. There are treasures in almost every 
barrel and crate. Don't miss the one behind the Chocobo stable, and in the 
barrel on the walkway above it. Next, go into the big house at the north of 
the town (this is the rich man's house). In the room that's drafty, walk 
behind the bookshelf and down some hidden stairs. Head down the next flight. 
In the hallway, walk to the right, then, when it goes down, walk through 
the wall, then to your right down a hidden flight of stairs for some nice 
relics. Continue exploring the rest of the hallway for a truckload of money, 
then go back to the entry hallway of the rich man's house. Go through the 
left door (not the one you came in from), and explore the barrels there. 
Walk behind the house to find a hidden passage, and explore that room for 
some goodies. There's a hidden door at the very bottom of the room that 
takes you to the old cider guy's house (remember that he wants cider for 
later). Exit there, then go to the item, armor, and weapon shops. Buy all 
the equipment you need (you should have enough money), then leave the town. 
If you wish, you may rent a Chocobo and take it to Sabin's Cottage (north of 
S. Figaro), which is suggested if you want some drama. Then head for Mt. 
Kolts (to the east). You should build your members up 2 or 3 levels outside, 
then use a tent, save, and enter. The enemies here are pretty strong, so, 
when you get the opportunity, use a tent and save. At the entrance, go behind 
the large rock and outside for some treasure. Go back, then head up. Follow 
the pathway (it's very linear), save your game at the designated spot, then 
continue until you reach Vargas. Defeat his bears, then attack him. After a 
while, Sabin will jump in, and the others will be blown away by one of Vargas' 
techniques. Fight Vargas with the Fight command (or you can perform a Blitz 
immediatley). When it tells you to do the Blitz, do so (duh). If you're 
having trouble, see the closing remarks of this section for the easiest way 
to perform the Pummel Blitz. When you beat him (that is, if you beat him), 
head out of the cave, grabbing the treasure chest on your way.  
        
        Once outside, head north to the Returner Hideout. Explore it with 
Terra, and see the closing remarks before you talk to Banon outside. Locke 
will leave the party, and then you'll be in a group with Banon, Terra, Edgar, 
and Sabin. Go back into the hideout to buy some items and stop at the inn. 
Then head out on the river. It doesn't really matter what ways you choose to 
go (although if you choose right at the first intersection, you'll fight more 
enemies, and if you keep going to the left at the second, it'll never end). 
Make sure that you have Banon use Heal during battles, and that you save your 
game at every opportunity. Eventually you'll reach Ultros. Have Terra use 
Fire, but beware: Ultros will blind you if she does. Make Banon use Heal 
every time he attacks, while Sabin uses any one of his Blitzes and Edgar 
fights or uses AutoCrossbow. You'll beat him, then Sabin will fall off. 
        
        Here are some tips and tactics that you may want to use: 

1)  In order for the Pummel Blitz to work, select Blitz from the menu, then
press left, release it, press right, release it, left and 'A'. Make sure 
that this is done within 1 and a half seconds. 

2)  Make sure that you buy the 3 tools at Figaro. Or at least the 
AutoCrossbow and Noise Blaster. 

3)  You will need plenty of Tonic, Potion, and Fenix Down. Tents are also 
important, but you will usually find them. The others can be found if you 
search in the Returner Hideout and S. Figaro. 

4)  If you can't afford a lot of weapons and armor, at least buy the best 
possible stuff for Terra, as she's weak in the beginning. 

5)  When Banon asks Terra to help the Returners, you will receive a Gauntlet 
for a 'Yes' reply. However, if you choose 'No,' go back inside and to the 
top-most room. The person there will give you a Genji Glove, which, in my 
view, is much more valuable. 

6)  When you are controlling Terra alone in the Returner's Hideout, walk up
to the very top of the large table (where the meeting will take place later). 
Press A and you will find a piece of paper. If you throw it away, nothing
different will happen. However, if you leave it there, Banon will throw it 
away during the meeting. I don't know what importance this plays (if any), 
but if someone can figure it out, tell me!

7)  Before beginning the raft ride on the Lete River, move Banon to the back 
row of your party. This will reduce the damage he takes. Remember, if he 
dies, the game ends! 

                       ------------------------- 

(2)  A Fork in the Road 
        
        Here the story has split into 3 groups. Mog appears and asks you 
to choose a scenario (Kupo!). You should save your game here so that you 
can come back if you make a mistake. I suggest going the Locke's first, 
then Sabin's, and finally Terra's. 


Locke's Scenario 
----------------        
        Locke's scenario can be difficult if you don't listen to the clues 
given by the townspeople. You must first go to the old man's house, and 
talk to the boy downstairs. Then go to the item shop and talk to the man in 
the corner. You'll fight him. Steal from him for a nice Plumed Hat, and 
his clothes! Equip the Plumed Hat, and go back to the boy in the old man's 
house. He let you through. Explore the town for some tips, but DON'T talk 
to soldiers in Magitek Armor. If you wish, talk to a Green Soldier and 
steal his clothes, then talk to the people in the town for more info. The 
soldier outfit also lets you talk to other soldiers without being attacked. 
Remember the Cider delivery man? Go there and fight him. Steel from him 
for another Plumed Hat and his clothes. You'll also take his Cider. Bring 
this back to the old man, then go to the boy who's downstairs. The password 
is 'courage.' Anything else gets you beaten up! Take the hidden passage to 
the rich man's house, then go upstairs. In the windy room, go behind the 
bookshelf and follow the passage too the room where Celes is. Save her, 
then take the guard's clock key. Go to the clock that isn't ticking and 
wind it for a secret passage. Enter and head right, then down, right, up, 
right, down, and left to a few treasure chests. Take the contents and equip 
them. Go back to the entrance and search along the walls for a hidden 
passage. Go south in the passage to some more treasure, then, about half 
way back in this passage, push to the left for another passage. Go 
downstairs and take the valuable items from the chests (don't miss the Ribbon, 
which is behing the north chest!). Return upstairs to the entrance, then take 
the other passage south. Go left for some treasure, then head right to find 
the exit. Leave S. Figaro and go to Figaro Cave. Make your way through until 
the TunnelArm comes. Defeat it by having Celes use Runic while Locke fights. 
 
Sabin's Scenario 
----------------        
        This is the longest (and hardest) of the three scenarios. Although 
it is your choice to enlist Shadow or not, you should take him along. If 
you do, buy at least 30 - 50 Shurikens. Search the Imperial Camp for 
treasures. When you find a locked treasure chest, hit it instead of kicking 
it, or you'll be attacked. After fighting Kefka once, head left and up 
behind a tent for entry to a hidden tent. When Cyan has to fight, use the 
Dispatch SwdTech command (number 1). When you win the Black Belt, equip it 
on somebody (preferably Shadow or Sabin). You can't enter Doma Castle after 
it's taken over, so head straight for the Baren Falls. On the Phantom Train, 
head right at the start to save your game and meet the Impresario. Head to 
the left, collecting treasures. Let the ghost guy join you, and have him 
Possess an enemy. To defeat the Ghost Train, use Cyan's Dispatch, Sabin's 
Suplex, and have Shadow through the Shuriken. At the bottom of Baren Falls, 
you'll meet Gau. Head to Mobliz, and buy some goods there. Make sure to 
buy some Dried Meat also. Fight in a battle in the Veldt and, when Gau 
appears, use the Dried Meat on him. Here's the appearance of the coolest
imp, Kappa! Head with Gau to the Crescent Cave, and explore for a few 
laughs. Eventually you'll find the diving helmet. Use it to go into the 
Serpent Trench. When you have to decide which way to go, choosing 2 rights 
takes you to both caves, while two lefts takes you straight to Nikeah. You're 
better off visiting the caves, as the second one has a valuable Green Beret. 
Once you arrive at Nikeah, buy some goods, then take the ship to S. Figaro. 
 
Terra's Scenario 
----------------
        This is the easiest of the scenarios. If you can't figure this one 
out, you really need a mental examination! Just remember to say hello to 
the Moogles. KUPO!!! 

                        ------------------------- 

(3)  Reunited 

        Finally together, the group doesn't have much time to think. Kefka 
and a squad of soldiers are on their way to claim the frozen Esper and kill 
Banon! Although some of the group's members are negative toward each other, 
they decide that they must stop the Empire at all costs. A decisive battle is 
about to take place. 
        
        The fight shouldn't be difficult IF you use the correct attacks. 
Edgar should constantly use the Bio Blaster, as this can destroy an entire 
enemy group! Have Cyan use the Quadra Slam, while Celes and Terra fight and 
cure with magic. If you still are having trouble, don't worry about losing. 
Instead, keep fighting with Sabin's group until he learns the Fire Dance, 
then use that to waste the enemies. Battle Kefka with a combination of magic 
users and fighters. After the battle, the group goes to the Esper, where 
Terra morphs for the first time. Unfortunately, she goes ballistic, 
and flies off to the west. 

                       ------------------------- 

(4)  The Search for Terra 
        
        After Terra flys away you'll be in Narshe. Buy and equip some 
weapons, armor, and relics, but, if Sabin or Edgar is in your party, don't 
buy items. Search the town for a room filled with treasures, and remember 
about the locked treasure chest. You should go to Figaro Castle. There, 
buy tools and items. If Sabin or Edgar is at the front of your party, you 
get them for half price! Submerge the castle, then head for Kohlingen. If 
Locke is in your party, you'll see a few cinema scenes. If you only have 3 
people with you and 3000 GP, then you can enlist Shadow for a little while. 
If you're not in a hurry, head north to the small house where the Coliseum 
will be in the World of Ruin. Search the house for a valuable Hero Ring. 
Head south to Jidoor, where you should search the town. Then head north to 
Zozo. You may want to gain a few levels before you enter. Upon entering, 
head as far left as you can, and find the building with the stopped clock. 
Set it for 6:10:50, and you'll find a passage to the valuable Chainsaw. 
Head down to the large tower, where you should proceed to climb it. Make 
sure to find every treasure chest along the way, as one holds the Thief 
Glove, which makes Locke use Control, allowing him to fight and steal in one 
turn. When you think you can't go any farther, try jumping between 
buildings. Continue up the tower until you fight Dadaluma. Use your 
strongest attacks on him, as well as Potions and Cure spells to recover your 
HP. When he calls reinforcements, ignore them and concentrate on him. 
Head upstairs to the topmost room, and look around for a few treasures. Then 
go up to Terra. 
                        
                        -------------------------

(5)  The Opera House
        
        After finding Terra, you must pick 2 people to go with Celes and 
Locke. Depending on your actions, Cyan may stay with Terra. If you haven't
already gotten Shadow, DO NOT go back to put him in your party! If you do,
he'll leave during the Opera, and you'll be stuck with 3 fighters untill after
the Magitek Factory! Go back to Kohlingen, and talk to everyone in the town. 
Then go to Owzer's house (the one farthest north), and talk to the Impresario. 
Read the letter and talk to the man, then head for the Opera House (it's south
of Jidoor). When you arrive, enjoy the cinema scene, then go with Locke to
the dressing room. When performing the opera, press A immediately on the 
first choice. For the second, press down, then A. On the third, press A. Go 
upstairs, and walk over to Draco. Follow him, and when he stops, press A 
as if to talk with him. Pick up the flowers, then go upstairs. Half way up, 
you'll stop. Press to the right, then continue up. Walk to the balcony, and 
enjoy! With Locke, pick up the note in the room, and talk to the Impresario. 
Equip the Sprint Shoes (if you don't have them on), and go up and right on 
the balcony. Talk to the man, then pull the far right switch. Go back 
to where you were sitting and head to the left, then up. When you're above 
the stage, try to avoid as many rats as possible. If you have to fight 
them, kill the yellow ones first, because they can call reinforcements. 
When you reach Ultros, you'll fall onto the stage, then fight him. 
Use your strongest moves, and he'll eventually leave. Setzer will come up. 
Watch the scene, and prepare for the trek through the Empire. Now, wasn't 
that fun?
                       
                       -------------------------

(6)  Magitek Factory
        
        When you reach Albrook, buy some new weapons, armor, and relics 
(the best available), then gain a few levels outside. Use the Espers to 
learn some magic spells, especially Cure1. You may want to go to Tzen and 
Maranda to find more weapons and info, but you don't need to. Head to Vector 
(it's the big castle). DON'T sleep at the inn. Instead, go over to the
small building and refuse to pledge your allegiance to the Empire. Fight 
the guards, and the man will heal you. Buy weapons (if you haven't already 
done so), dodge the soldiers in the north of town, and enter the buildings. 
When you think you're ready, go to the right and talk to the man behind the 
boxes. Climb onto the box, and go over the guards to get into the factory. 
Make sure Celes has a sword, because you will want to use Runic often. 
Explore the first room thoroughly, you should find 2 or 3 treasures. Climb 
into the left pipe, and go downstairs. Remember, there are a lot of 
treasures hear. Try pressing against the far southern walls, and you will 
probably find doors leading to a few treasures. Equip all of the Flame and 
Thunder equipment that you find, and look for Kefka. Jump off where Kefka 
threw the 2 creatures, than talk to the left one. For Ifrit, use strong 
Ice attacks, and use Fire attacks on Shiva. They'll turn into Magicite. 
Go through the left door, use a tent, and save your game (by the way, have 
Locke steal from soldiers to get tents). Go back through the door, and go 
into the right one this time. Go all the way up the stairs, and search the 
room with several Esper Processing Chambers for the Break Blade. Go
throug the next doorway to fight #024. It is difficult to hurt him with 
magic (he changes what he is weak against when he glows), so use 
primarily fighting attacks. The Aura Bolt and Dispatch techniques work 
best. Go up through the door, and talk to Cid. Watch the cinema scene, 
then follow Cid. Use a tent and save your game and talk to Cid. In the
mine cart, use strong fighting techniques and Ice and Fire spells on the
Mag Roaders. When you fight #128, attack the body, not the arms, with
strong Ice and Thunder attacks. Save your game when you are outside, 
and talk to Setzer. When you fight the Cranes, use strong magic (you 
might want to Scan to see what they're weak against), and Setzer's Slot. 
If the Slot lands on 3 diamonds, you'll probably win.

                      -------------------------

(7)  To the Sealed Gate!
        
        Oh boy! You get to control the airship. JOY!!! Fly to Narshe. 
Remember the locked treasure chest? Go to that house and follow Lone Wolf 
to where the Esper is (at the cliff). When he tells you not to step 
forward, stand still. When Mog wrestles free, both will almost fall of the 
cliff. You only have time to save one. If you save Mog, he joins your 
party (kupo)! If you save Lone Wolf, you get a Gold Hairpin, which cuts in 
half the magic needed for the wearer to cast spells. I STRONGLY suggest 
taking Mog! You may want to fight with him in forests, plains, different 
backgrounds, until he learns his dances. See the "A Few Tips and Secrets" 
section for info on getting the Water Rondo dance. When you're ready, fly 
to the Imperial Base. Nobody will be there. Go to across the bridge and to 
the cave. You'll find a valuable treasure at the beginning, so take it. 
When you reach the room with moving bridges, make your way to the treasure 
chest on the little island. It holds the Coin Toss, which lets Setzer kill 
the enemy with money! Follow the route, and, when you pull a switch that 
makes you hear a distant sound, backtrack to reach a treasure chest. When 
you reach the area with 2 switches on the floor, DON'T step on either of 
them. Instead, pass the first one, then go up the right bridge. Pull the 
switch in the chest, and go downstairs, then down again. Go to your left to 
the little raised piece of ground, and step on the switch. It will open a 
cave with the VERY valuable Atma Weapon in it! Equip it on Terra. Keep 
going to the right, until you eventually reach the Sealed Gate. Hit Kefka 
once, and enjoy the show! When it's over, exit the cave through the new 
passage, and go to the airship. Oh, by the way, the ninja that falls from the
ceiling mentions a treasure under a staircase. This treasure is the locked
room in the Imperial Base. If do the right things at the banquet (coming up),
you will be able to open the door.

                        -------------------------

(8)  Search for the Espers
        
        After the Sealed Gate, talk to the people in Maranda. They have 
new things to say. Head to Vector, and go to the cattle. You'll talk to 
Geshtal and Cid. Talk to as many soldiers as possible. You may have to 
fight some. DON'T talk to Kefka, as he takes away from your time to talk to 
soldiers. When you have talked to 24 soldiers, wait out the timer. During 
the conference, be as courteous and polite as possible when talking. You 
should toast to the Hometowns, say to keep Kefka in jail, and that their 
actions were inexcusable. I don't know the rest, but, if you do everything 
correctly, South Figaro will be freed, Doma Castle will be freed, the door 
in the Imperial Base will be unlocked (if this happens, go back there to 
collect mucho money and weaponry), you'll receive a Tintinabar (see the "A 
Few Tips and Secrets" section for how to get another one), and you'll get a 
valuable Charm Bangle. Go to the Imperial Base if the door was opened, then 
go to Albrook. Go to the ship, and enjoy the cinema scene. Afterwards, 
sleep at the inn for free for another cinema scene. Go back to the ship, 
and you'll set sail. When you reach Crescent Island, head north to Thamasa. 
Press A next to the barrels and boxes for some prizes, and by new weapons 
and armor. Some of the relics are also useful. Explore until you find 
Strago and Relm. Sleep at the inn, and go to the burning house. Enter with 
Strago. If you have it, equip Strago with the Ice Rod, and use Ice and the 
Aqua Rake spells on your enemies. Try to avoid the fireballs, and 
eventually you'll reach a big fireball. Defeat him with Ice2 and Aqua Rake. 
Shadow will save the day. When all is done, see if there's any equipment 
you could use at the shops, then head for the Crescent Cave. Save outside, 
and go up a few levels. Take the treasure chest immediately to your left, 
then head up and right, through the door. When you're outside, work your 
way to the left, and into another cave. Pick up any treasure, and you'll 
eventually reach the 3 Golden Statues. When fighting Ultros, use the 
strongest fire attacks possible, and, when Relm joins you, have her sketch 
Ultros. You'll win (for now), and head out the left door. Save when you 
have the chance, and, when you see 3 tiles on the ground, step on the 
upper-left one. Go out the door and collect the treasure, then go back 
inside and upstairs. Fall through the upper-right one, and continue until 
there's a cinema scene. When in Thamasa, watch the action. Fight Kefka 
with General Leo, it should be easy. Unfortunately, Leo is killed by Kefka 
(see the Rumors section for possible info on bringing him back to life). 
Board the airship when the party comes, and watch the cinema scene.

(9)  The Floating Continent
        
        After Thamasa, fly to Doma Castle (if it was freed), and, if you 
wish, South Figaro. Gain several levels (you'll need to for the upcoming 
battles), and save somewhere. Board the airship, and choose to look for 
the Floating Continent. You'll battle the IAF (pretty tough, cure between 
battles), and you'll face off with Ultros and his friend, Chupon. Use fire 
attacks on Ultros, and all of your strong ice and special attacks on Chupon. 
Chupon will eventually sneeze you away, and you'll fall. You'll fight a 
machine on your way down! Concentrate on the body itself, and destroy the 
little machines it releases that absorb magic. You have to hurry, because 
when the countdown ends, you'll be fried! You'll end up on the Floating 
Continent. Talk to Shadow and he'll join you. Make sure to save your game 
so that you don't have to face the IAF again. The battles here are tough, 
so you should have Shadow throw Shurikens and Ninja Stars, as well as 
different Skeans. When you think you've reached a dead end, try pressing 
against the wall. Basically, you should make your way to the right, 
collecting the blue orbs (treasure chests). Don't miss the Masmune, or any 
other treasures. When you find a save place (haven't seen one of those for 
a while), use a tent and save. Soon you'll have the option to go back to 
the airship or not. You really should keep going. Fight the Atma Monster 
using very strong ice spells, and all of your best attacks. Cure2 is 
imperative to your survival, so make sure somebody has learned it by now. 
When you win, head up and enjoy the long cinema scene. Shadow will trap 
Kefka between the statues, and a timer will come up. Hurry to your right. 
If you have the Charm Bangle, equip it now. When you defeat the enemy at 
the glowing star, continue going right. When it asks if you want to jump 
to the airship or wait, choose wait. Move back a step and step forward. 
Choose to wait for Shadow. If you don't, you can't get him later!!! At 
about 5 seconds left, Shadow will come, and you'll escape. Enjoy the 
splendor of the end of the world!
 
                      -------------------------

(10)  What You Should Have Done By Now
        
        By now you should have found the 12 normal characters, and no hidden 
ones. You will have 11 if you didn't save Mog. If you neglected Mog, 
you'll have to wait for the next chance to find him. By now your characters 
should be at least at level 25, that being the minimum. Sabin should have 
learned the Fire Dance (maybe the next one also), and Cyan should know the 
Quadra Slam. Make sure that you found the Atma Weapon before this point, 
or you won't be able to get it back. You could live without it, but it is 
probably the best weapon in the game.

                      -------------------------
 
(11)  A Few Tips and Secrets
        
        If you want to gain levels quickly, then you should stay near the 
beginning of the Floating Continent. The enemies here can be defeated, and 
they give you a lot of experience. If it's magic that you want, go to the 
Triangle Island (upper left corner of map). Defeat the invisible Intangir 
by casting Doom, but beware: it will cast a powerful spell on the person 
who kills it. Have your party above 1000 HP each. 
        
        If you think that the Atma Weapon is faulty or doesn't work, that's 
because it gains power as you gain HP. The more HP you have, the stronger 
it is. Remember, if you're low on HP, it will hardly do anything. 
        
        Terra's Morph will lasts longer at higher levels, and if you go 
many battles without using it.
        
        Many people wonder how to get two of Mog's dances; the Water Rondo 
and the Snowman Jazz. The Snowman Jazz can be learned in the World of 
Ruin only, but the Water Rondo MUST be learned in the World of Balance. 
The W. Rondo is, in fact, Mog's strongest dance. To acquire it, form a 
group with Mog in it. Land the airship it Nikeah, and rent a Chocobo. 
Ride it all the way to Baren Falls, and hop off. Jump the falls, and go 
all the way to the Serpent Trench, and jump in. Fight a water enemy 
without dancing and you'll learn the Water Rondo! You'll end up in Nikeah, 
right next to your airship! An alternate, longer route is to take the raft 
down the Lete River with Mog. The Serpent Trench is much faster, though.
        
        If you want Mog's Dance to have a 100% success rate, then use the
dance that goes along with the background you're in. The other dances still
work, but there's the possibility that you will stumble.
        
        To save Shadow on the Floating Continent, during the destruction, 
wait instead of jumping onto the ship. If you stand there until only 5 
seconds are left, he'll come and you'll leave together.
        
        There is a trick that works on almost all enemies and bosses in the 
game. Have somebody learn Vanish, and have somebody who knows either Doom 
or X-Zone. When you Vanish someone, weapons won't hurt them, but magic will 
have a 100% success rate! Cast Doom, and the enemy will die! Later in the 
game, enemies don't always die from Vanish/Doom, but instead die from 
Vanish/X-Zone. The X-Zone works on 99% of the enemies in the game! BEWARE, 
though that Vanish/X-Zone doesn't allow you to collect any items from the 
enemy!!!
        
        In Mobliz, it is possible to get a valuable Tintinabar. Talk to 
the injured soldier, and read the letter on the desk. Go to the house in 
the center of town and send something in the mail. After going back and 
forth and spending a lot of money on mail, the soldier will give you a 
Tintinabar!

                  ***THE WORLD OF RUIN WALKTHROUGH***


(1)  Stranded on a Deserted Island
        
        This is a very short part of the story, but can be very dramatic. 
To pick up fish for Cid, go to the beach south of the house and press A 
next to a fish. Remember: the faster the fish, the healthier it is. 
There are 4 types of fish: Rotten Fish, Fish, Just a Fish, and Yummy Fish. 
If you feed Cid 10 Yummy Fish (the very fast moving ones), he'll live! 
If you take to long to catch the fish, or if you feed him Rotten Fish, Cid 
will die, and Celes will almost commit suicide. In the secrets section, it 
tells you just why saving Cid is so important. Either way, you'll set sail 
using a raft that Cid made.
                       
                       -------------------------

(2)  There's Still Hope!
        
        In Albrook, talk to the people to learn of the World of Ruin. 
You'll hear about the 8 dragons, Phunbaba, and Doom Gaze, as well as 
Kefka's reign of terror. Buy new equipment (you'll need it) and sleep 
at the inn. When you leave town, head north past Kefka's Tower and 
through a desert. Eventually you'll reach Tzen. Save outside, and when 
you enter, a disaster hits. Go the inn for HP and MP if you must, then go 
up to Sabin. Enter the house, taking the treasures, and head to the left. 
Go downstairs, and up to the long landing. The child should be above the 
fireplace. Take it outside, and Sabin will join you. Buy equipment for him 
if you must, and save outside. Go north-west and find a small forest. In 
the middle, rent a Chocobo and go south. Go east across a bridge and follow 
the green trail that was once the Serpent Trench to Mobliz. There, sleep at 
the house and talk to Terra. You'll fight Phunbaba, who can be stopped by 
strong ice spells, the poison and bio spells, and the Suplex Blitz. 
Terra won't join you, but you can't give up now.

                        -------------------------

(3)  Edgar!
        
        After the fight with Phunbaba, head south to a forest where you can 
rent a Chocobo. Follow the Serpent Trench past the Fanatics' Tower and to 
the town of Nikeah. Talk to the thieves at the inn, and, when they leave, 
go outside and talk to Gerard (he looks like Edgar). Follow Gerard into the 
ship, and, at South Figaro, locate him at the inn. Buy new weapons, armor, 
relics, and items at the town, and go to Figaro Cave to the north-east. 
Follow Gerard, the thieves, and the Sigfried impostor to the Recovery 
Spring. Remember that opening on the other side? Jump on the turtle and 
enter it. It leads to Figaro Castle. If you search the cave, you may find
Sigfried, but he runs away. Go to the engine room and down the 
stairs that you couldn't enter before. Collect the treasures, and find the 
engine. Gerard will reveal himself, and you'll fight the Tentacles. It 
is good to have relics protecting you from poison and berserk, and some 
Running Shoes. Have Celes cast Regen on everyone. Each Tentacle gets 
injured by different magic. Have Edgar use the Chainsaw, Flash, or Drill, 
Sabin use the Aura Bolt, and Celes use magic to cure or runic. When you 
win, go through the door and press A by the statue for the Soul Sabre. 
Go back the way you came, and the engineer will make the castle go to 
Kohlingen. Buy the new items and tools at half price by putting Edgar or 
Sabin at the front of your party, and head out for Kohlingen to the 
north-east.

                         -------------------------

(4)  One Airship to Go, Please!
        
        When you find Setzer in the cafe of Kohlingen, he'll join you. Buy 
new equipment from the shops. Equip Setzer with either the Dice or the 
Trump. Go to Darill's Tomb and save outside. From the beginning, go down 
stairs and to the right. Go up through the door, and press A on the 
tombstone. A door will open, which you should go through. Flip the switch 
at the top of the room and the water will go down. Return to the main 
hallway and go down. Keep going and collect the treasure chest. Once again 
go to the main hallway, only go all the way to the left and down (if you 
REALLY want to solve the tombstone puzzle, go down the center twice, and 
read each of the tombstones. Go to the main hallway, into the upper-left 
door, and put in THE WORLD IS SQUARE backwards). Go down the next set of 
stairs and collect the chest to your right. Move against the right wall and 
you'll find a hidden passage that leads to a treasure chest that contains 
the valuable Experience Egg! Go back through the passage, and in the door 
to the north. Walk across the water and flip the switch. You'll see a door 
open. Return to the main hallway and go down through the center door. 
Flip the switch, then jump on the turtle. It'll take you to the door, 
which you should go through. Open up the right chest, than use a tent and 
save your game. You'll have to fight a dangerous enemy in the left chest, 
but, once defeated, he yields 1 or 2 powerful Fire Claws for Sabin. Save 
your game again, and go through the northern door. Walk up to the casket 
to fight Dullahan. Have Sabin use Blitzes and the Fire Claw, Setzer uses 
the Dice and Slot, Celes casts Fire and Cure spells, and Edgar uses the 
Chainsaw or Drill. It shouldn't be to hard. When done, go up through the 
door, and enjoy the cinema scene. You'll take off in the airship and 
follow a bird to Maranda.

                         -------------------------

(5)  Cyan's Grievances
        
        When you first take off in the new airship, you'll see a bird, and 
follow it to Maranda. In the house in the upper-right, a girl says she's 
been receiving letters from her love in Mobliz, but you know that he's dead. 
The handwriting on the letter is that of Cyan, so you follow the pigeon 
back to Zozo. There, talk to the man that told the truth the first time 
(he's up and to the right of the big tower), and he'll give you info and 
Rust-aid. Go into the Cafe and find the rusty door, which will become 
unrusted. Go through to end up on Mt. Zozo. Make your way through the 
first room, making sure to collect the treasures. In the second room, 
use a tent and save your game, then step on the switch to your upper-right. 
This will release one of the 8 dragons from a treasure chest. Fight it 
using your strongest abilities. You should win. Continue climbing the 
mountain until you find Cyan. Enjoy the cinema scene! When it's done, you 
can go to where Cyan was and get the key to open his treasure chest, open 
the chest, and take his books, although they don't do anything. Make your 
way out of Zozo or use a Warp Stone (or Warp magic), and fly back to Maranda 
with Cyan in your group. Talk to the townspeople again.

                        ------------------------

(6)  Face to Face With Phunbaba
        
        It's time to check back on Terra in Mobliz. When you do, you'll 
notice that she's gone. Go into the house where Duane is, and follow the 
dog into a secret passage behind the bookcase. There's an Elixir hidden in 
one of the pots. You'll have to fight Phunbaba again, so make sure that 
you're healed up. Use the same tactics as when you fought him before. 
Midway through, Terra will morph and join you in the fight. It should 
be easy with her magic skills. Terra will rejoin the party, and you can 
now continue your adventure.
                        
                        ------------------------

(7)  To the Veldt!
        
        Short chapter! Anyway, all you have to do is fight a battle in 
the Veldt with 3 people in your party. Gau will rejoin you, and will have 
learned a few new Rages. If you wish, you may take him and Sabin to the 
house in the north-west. There, Gau will meet his father. It's both funny 
and a tear-jerker.

                        ------------------------

(8a)  Save Shadow

Note: You can only save Shadow if you waited for him back on the Floating 
      Continent!!!
        
        This is a split scenario. If you waited for Shadow on the Lost 
Continent, then Shadow will be waiting in the Veldt Cave. Go there and 
follow Interceptor. BE SURE to open EVERY treasure chest in the cave, 
or you may miss the valuable Striker!!! Eventually you'll find Shadow 
lying on the ground (it's after a save location). Be ready, because you'll 
have to battle two powerful Behemoths! Use Ice magic, and you shouldn't 
have trouble. However, get ready! Just after beating the first, another 
will trap you from behind! This one is easy. Just use the item `Revivify' 
on it to kill it. When you do defeat it, you'll take Shadow to Thamasa. 
After sleeping at the inn, he'll disappear, having gone to the Coliseum. 
Make sure to search the left wall of Strago's house (upstairs) for another 
Memento Ring. You'll hear about a man dressed in black searching for a 
Striker. Bet the Striker (you should have found it in the cave), and you'll 
fight Shadow (even though it says Shadow Chupon). You'll easily defeat him, 
and he'll join your party for good!

                         ------------------------

(8b)  Save Relm
        
        No matter what, Relm will end up at Owzer's House (at the top of 
Jidoor). Go there, and, after trying to go up the stairs, read Owzer's 
Diary. Press A on the lamp (near the stairs), then go up. If you wish, 
fight the flower portrait. Look at the picture of Geshtahl twice for a clue 
about the Phoenix Cave. Then look at the woman's portrait. When you defeat 
the enemy, enter the door. Follow the path (some of the portraits do 
things, so watch out), and, when you find 3 doors on 1 wall, walk behind 
the wall and press A for the valuable Relic Ring (makes Doom/Poison cure, 
and Cure/Life injure). Go through the left-most door. If you wish, stand 
under the floating chests to fight an enemy. You have to go to each one in 
a certain order. Then go through the door. Save your game, and go through 
the right door (the left is a trap). Fight the Spirit Chadarnook, using 
strong fire attacks on the demon form. You may want to cast Remedy on 
everyone, because one of his moves damages everyone over time. He'll 
transform, and, in doing so, change what he takes damage from. After 
winning (it may take a while), Relm will join your party.

                         ------------------------

(9)  Strago and Ebot's Rock
        
        Having saved Relm, take her to the Fanatics' Tower. A very confused 
Strago will be marching with some Kefka Worshippers, but will snap out of 
it when he sees Relm. Take both of them to Thamasa, and, after a cinema 
scene, buy some equipment and head to Ebot's Rock. Enter the cave and talk 
to the chest. Using the transporters, find 20 to 30 pieces of coral, then 
bring them back to the chest. The chest will move out of the way, and you 
can face Hidon. Take Strago along, and kill off the little Hidonites first, 
and Hidon will use Grand Train (which Strago will learn afterwards). Keep 
attacking with Fire and Cure attacks, and eventually Hidon will fall. 
Hopefully you got him to cast Grand Train, which is one of Strago's best 
Lore attacks. Enjoy the cinema scene.

                         ------------------------

(10)  Mog Lives!
        
        Remember the Moogle Village? Well, return there by going through 
the Narshe Caves. Mog will be there, and he'll join you. Search where he 
was standing for the Moogle Charm (avoids random enemy fights)! Take Mog 
with you, and, in the snowy area, fight the Ice Dragon. Use Fire attacks. 
Fight another enemy in the area and you'll learn the Snowman Jazz. Go to 
the frozen Esper and fight it. Use strong weapon attacks and Fire magic. 
When you thaw it out, you will receive its Magicite, and the cliff will 
break. Have Mog in your party, and jump off. Follow the cave's route, 
and you'll eventually reach a room with a bone carving. Take the Magicite 
from it, and Umaro the sasquatch will fight you. Defeat him with powerful 
attacks, and, after beating him, Mog will forcibly make him join your party! 
When you fight the dragon in the Opera House, equip everyone with a Cherub 
Down relic (which you can buy in Jidoor).

(10)  Mog Lives!
        
        Remember the Moogle Village? Well, return there by going through 
the Narshe Caves. Mog will be there, and he'll join you. Search where he 
was standing for the Moogle Charm (avoids random enemy fights)! Take Mog

attacks, and, after beating him, Mog will forcibly make him join your party! 
When you fight the dragon in the Opera House, equip everyone with a Cherub 
Down relic (which you can buy in Jidoor).

                         ------------------------

(11)  Phoenix Cave
        
        Having Mog in your party, take him to the Phoenix Cave. Put him 
in one of your parties and equip him with the Moogle Charm. You may also 
want to have Umaro, because of his immunity to fire attacks. Follow the 
mazes twists and turns, and notice how most of the chests are empty. Look 
carefully at the ground for difficult-to-see switches. You'll eventually 
end at a dragon (make sure to save your game). Fight the dragon, or, if 
you're weak, leave it for later. Use strong ice attacks. Afterwards, go 
back up and stand on the switch to make the rocks appear. Have the other 
party leap across using the rocks, then head down with both parties. Have 
each stand on one of the 2 switches, and the raised land will lower. Follow 
the path, and you'll find Locke! Enjoy the cinema scene, then take Locke 
to Narshe. Search the weapon shop and the northern shop for the Ragnarok 
Sword/Esper and Cursed Shield. I suggest you take the Esper, and read 
the Secrets section for another way to learn Ultima.

                         ------------------------

(12)  Fanatics' Tower
        
        Go to the Fanatics' Tower with your strongest magic users (or, if 
you wish, include Umaro). You may wish to learn a lot of magic before 
entering, and make sure that everyone knows Osmose. Equip someone with 
the Siren Esper, and have somebody know Life3. Berserk also helps. It is 
also suggested to know the Ultima spell, as it will wipe out even the 
toughest of enemies in a few attacks. Equip strong magic-defending 
equipment, such as Force Armor and the Force Shield. Use the Siren Esper 
to perform an almost 100% working Mute attack! Fight your way to the first 
treasure room, and take the treasure. Then move to the right of the chest, 
walk up, and press A. You'll here a noise. Go out the room and downstairs 
to the new door. Enter and take the Air Anchor (one of Edgar's Tools). 
Then continue your journey up the tower. If you fight a Magic Barrel, DON'T 
KILL IT! Instead, let it heal you until it runs away. You'll fight a 
Dragon, which should be easy with the Ultima spell. At the top of the 
tower, take the Gem Box and equip it on the strongest magic user. When you 
fight the Magi Master, cast Life3 on as many people as possible (but at 
least one). The Magi Master changes what he can be hurt by magicwise, but, 
if you have the Berserk spell, cast it on him to keep him from changing. 
It will be a tough, long battle. However, if you have the Ultima spell, 
USE IT NOW!!! If you cast Life3 on somebody, then you'll win after he uses 
Ultima. Now head back down the tower (easier said than done, unless you 
have the Moogle Charm equipped).

                         ------------------------

(13)  Cyan's Dream
        
        You should be able to make it as far as the Three Dream Stooges on 
your own. Kill the flying one first, as that one can cast Life on the 
others. Once he's down, the rest should be easy. After that, you'll 
continue through Cyan's mind. When you find the Lump of Metal, go up to the 
moving chest and press A to put the metal in the chest, stopping it (you 
won't lose it, though). Flip the switch and study the chests. When you 
find another group of six chests later, enter the same pattern and flip the 
switch to move on. In Magitek Armor, go down, then to the right. Enter 
the cave, than walk out. Fall through the bridge. In Doma Castle, save 
your game, and feel free to walk around, witnessing Cyan's memories of his 
family. Head to the throne room and fight Wrexsoul. When he enters 
somebody's body, either kill each other off one at a time until he appears, 
or use Life3 on everyone and kill the party. After that, either use 
Vanish/X-Zone or use strong fire attacks. You'll end up with a nifty Aura 
sword for Cyan, and he'll learn the final few SwdTech attacks!

                        ------------------------

(14)  Tastes Like Gogo
        
        When on Triangle Island, fight the Zone Eater (the only enemy there), 
and have everyone be engulfed. You'll be in a cave. On the bridges, don't 
touch the green guys or you'll be knocked off (although there are some 
handy treasures down there). Make sure to get the Fake Mustache (changes 
Sketch into Control). Work your way past the deadly falling ceiling room 
(stand under the small openings to avoid being crushed), and you'll 
eventually find Gogo.

                         ------------------------

(15)  Kefka's Tower
        
        Oh no! You have to split up into 3 groups! The pain! The horror! 
Actually, it shouldn't be that hard if your near level 50. Basically, 
work your way through the hordes of enemies. If you're going for the 
Crusader Esper and the valuable Merton spell, defeat the 2 Dragons here. 
You'll have to fight Atma and a machine, whose name I forget. Fight the 3 
statues, saving after each victory. Make sure to equip the Sky Render on 
Cyan, and the Aura Lance on either Mog or Edgar. Then head for Kefka! 
Enjoy the dramatic cinema scene, then fight. Use Pearl, Ultima, and 
basically the strongest magic possible. Have somebody cast Life3 for the 
battle with Kefka, as he casts Fallen One, which makes your HP go down to 1. 
It shouldn't be too difficult.

                        ------------------------
 
(16)  Did You Get These Elusive Items?

The Chainsaw - put in 6:10:50 at the clock in Zozo.
Air Anchor   - press A right of the treasure chest, first room Fanatics' 
               Tower. Go downstairs.
Soul Sabre   - statue in treasure room, engine area of Figaro Castle.
Drainer      - chest in falling house, Tzen.
Illumina     - wager the Ragnarok Sword at Coliseum. Only if you took the 
               sword.
Tiger Fangs  - hidden room, Veldt Cave.
Imp Halberd  - win from Tyrannosaur.
Imp Armor    - steal from Tyrannosaur.
Marvel Shoes - wager Rename Card at Coliseum.
Merit Award  - wager Cat Hood at Coliseum.

                        ------------------------

(17)  A Few More Tips and Secrets
        
        How do you gain levels fast? Well, try fighting in the forest north 
of the Veldt. There you fight Tyrannosaurs, which give you a ton of 
experience!
        
        The best place for Gold AND Magic Points is in the desert south 
of Maranda. There you fight the Cactrot, which gives you 10 Magic Points 
and 10,000 GP!!!
        
        In the forest north of the Veldt (where you fight Tyrannosaurs), 
you'll occasionally fight the dangerous Brachosaur. This fearsome beast can 
cast Ultima! However, when you defeat it, there's a chance of receiving 
the VERY valuable Economizer! This awesome relic lowers all spells 
(and that includes Lore attacks) to only 1 MP!!!
        
        To learn Sabin's Bum Rush Blitz, bring Sabin to Duncan's House.
        
        If you're looking for Umaro, look in the "Mog Lives!" section. 
For Gogo, look under "Tastes Like Gogo."
        
        Check Gogo's Status. Press to the right, and you can pick 3 skills 
that you want him to use! That means he can not only mimic the attacks 
of his comrades, but he can also use Blitzes, Items, Tools, you name it!
        
        Taking the Ragnarok Esper allows you to learn the powerful spell 
Ultima! It has the power of FF2's Meteo, if not stronger!
        
        To face Doom Gaze, you must fly around in your ship until he attacks. 
Remember that he can't regenerate his HP after battle, so if you keep 
fighting him, he'll eventually die! DO NOT use Vanish/X-Zone on him, or you 
won't get the Bahamut Esper!!! Vanish/Doom is just fine.
        
        Many people wonder where the Megalixer is. Well, there are 3 that
appear normally through the game: one after beating the Magi Master, another
in Kefka's Tower, and one when you steal from Kefka. However, to get unlimit-
ed Megalixers, try casting Stop on the scorpion beastes in the desert of the 
Solitary Island, then stealing from them.
        
        To un-curse the Cursed Shield, fight with it in 255 battles. I 
suggest using a Ribbon to stop most of its dangerous effects. After the 
battles it will become the Paladin Shield, which is the most powerful shield 
in the game! It absorbs all elemental attacks, has a near 50% evade rate, 
a VERY high defense rate, and even teaches you Ultima! Of course, you can 
also trade the Cursed Shield in for a Cursed Ring at the Coliseum. After 
255 battles with this, you will get the Paladin Ring, which protects from 
Doom and status changes. It also teaches Ultima!
        
        So, how do you get the Cursed Ring without losing the Cursed Shield? 
Well, try fighting the Veterans or the Didalos of Kefka's Tower! They can be 
found in either of the rooms where you fight the 2 dragons! It may take a 
while, but you'll get a Cursed Ring!
        A very good source (I hope) says that, to find the secret ending, 
you must find every character, every Esper (includes Ragnarok and Raiden), 
and find all of the Paladin equipment (there's some possibly undiscovered).


Thanks and Happy FF3ing!

                         PART TWO-Monster List
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
By Seth Hardy                                  
Edited by Wizard 201                                          

This is a monster list for the game Final Fantasy III.
This is what it contains:

MONSTER NAME-The name of the monster as it appears in the game.
MONSTER'S LEVEL-Useful for using spells that pertain to levels.
MONSTER'S HP-How many Hit Points the monster has.
MONSTER'S MP-How many Magic Points the monster has.
MONSTER'S WEAK POINTS-What types of damage the monster is particulary 
vulnerable to.
MONSTER'S ITEMS-What you can get from the monster
(One of two ways: By using Locke's steal ability OR by killing the monster.)
MONSTER'S EXPERIENCE-How much experience you get from the monster (Total)
MONSTER'S GP-How many Gold Pieces you get from the monster.

This list was made by Seth Hardy (SethHardy@aol.com). It can be freely 
distributed, as long as:
1.This UNALTERED cover sheet is included with it,
2.I get full credit for it, and 
3.It is not sold for profit. I made this sheet to help everybody, not just
whoever has a spare dollar or two.

I hope this can help everybody. I have worked long and hard on this sheet,
hoping that everybody can make good use of it. This sheet is not yet 100% 
complete. There are many blank places on the list,
for various reasons: (Not having Locke/having Locke and not being able 
to steal/not having anyone who knows SCAN/etc.)
If anybody finds any information that is not on this list, PLEASE SEND 
IT TO ME!!!!! I will immediately put it on my list and after getting 
enough additions, I will upload the newest revision.

I would like to thank Dr. Gamewiz on AOL for encouraging me enough to 
finally get started on this, because I was putting making it off for 
quite a while. Because of his encouragement, I finally got started and 
here it is!!!!

Well, enjoy!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Any comments/ideas/input, just E-Mail me.

you left Shadow, you get nothing.


Final Fantasy as a Multiplayer Game
-----------------------------------
To use multiplayer mode, you go to the config screen and change it from 
single to multi, then hit A and assign to the controllers. It only works 
for the battles though, not the regular gameplay.

Special Character Notes
-----------------------
Edgar can use 8 "tools" in battle: autocrossbow, drill, bio blast,
debilitator, flash, chainsaw, noise blaster and air anchor.  Many
of these can be bought in Edgar's castle, South Figaro.

Sabin has special control pad techniques that are issued when the
"blitz" command is invoked.  Select "blitz", input the code and then
press A to continue.

     Pummel         =    L,R,L
     Mantra (heals) =    R,L,R,L,X,Y
     AuraBolt       =    D,DL,L
     Air Blade      =    U,UR,L,DR,D,DL,L (clockwise "roll")
     Suplex         =    X,Y,D,U
     Spiraler       =    R,L,X,Y,R,L
     Fire Dance     =    L,DL,D,DR,R (counter-clockwise "roll")
     Bum Rush       =    L,UL,U,UR,R,DR,D,DL,L
                         (total clockwise circle)

Cyan uses a special "sword technique" that must be "powered up"
when selected.

 

Controlling the Different Modes of Transporation
------------------------------------------------

L = left on control pad
R = right on control pad
U = up on control pad
D = down on control pad

UR = up/right diagnol
DR = down/right diagnol
DL = down/left diagnol
UL = up/left diagnol

LB = left button on top of control pad
RB = right button on top of control pad

A,B,X,Y = control buttons


Riding Chocobos
---------------

U = move forward
L or R = turn

A = move forward
B = dismount (Chocobo returns to stable)


Airship
-------

U or D = adjust height
L or R = turn

A = move forward
B = leave airship

X = switch to view inside airship
Y = turn airship when it's not moving

VANISH/DOOM/X-ZONE
------------------
Using Vanish and then Doom on enemies early in the game usually kills
them instantly, but as the game progresses, the rate of success is greatly
lowered. Using X-Zone in place of Doom, your chances will be increased to
99% possibility of killing an enemy.

LOCATIONS OF THE TWO SECRET CHARACTERS 
--------------------------------------
UMARO

In the WOR, go up to the top of the cliff where Tritoch is. Defeat the esper
and then jump into the crack that is left there. Be sure that you
have Mog with you. Work your way through the caves until you come to a bone
carving. Press A like you were talking to it and you will receive the magi-
cite "Terrato." Umaro will come out of what looks like a cave opening to the
north and you will fight him. When you beat him, Mog will force him to join
you.

GOGO

In the WOR, go to the triangle island and wander around until you fight a 
ZoneEater. Let it engulf all of your characters and you will be able to
explore the ZoneEater's stomach. If you search for a while, you will find
Gogo in the caverns.

                    ***SECRET ENDING REQUIREMENTS***

Remember, this is unproven, but has been given to us from a VERY
reliable source!  To witness the secret ending:

1.  Find every character.
2.  Find ever Esper (includes changing Odin to Raiden and taking the
    Ragnarok Magicite).
3.  Save Cid (don't let him die on the Solitary Island).
4.  Find all of the Paladin equipment (some pieces may not be discovered).
5.  Save Shadow on the Floating Island by waiting.

Hope that helps! If you find the secret ending, REPORT IT TO US!!!
 

                         
                          **The Best for FF3**

The Best for Fighting
---------------------

1)  Equip an Offering and Genji Glove. 8 swings of the weapon! Equip someone
with the Atma Weapon (level 60 and up) and another strong sword for over
60,000 HP of damage! Another possibility is to hold 2 Scimitars (or other
weapons that have special effects). Because you attack 8 times, it is highly
likely that the weapon will do something special!

2)  Rage Ring and Blizzard Orb. With these two relics, Umaro becomes a real
fighting machine!

3)  Equip a Thief Glove and an Offering on Locke. Use Capture, and you get 4
chances to steal from the enemy!

4)  Black Belt, Offering. If an enemy hits you, they're in for a big
surprise!

5)  Gogo, 3 of his skills as Steal, equipped with the Thief Glove and
Offering. Use this in the Coliseum if you want to steal from the enemy.

6)  So, you want to be Kappa? Well, try turning someone into an imp, then
equiping them with the Imp Halberd, Imp Armor, Tortoise Shield, and Titanium.
Now, all you have to do is rename the person Kappa, and you have a super
strong imp!

7)  Hero Ring and Offering. This recovers some of the power of the weapon
that is lost with the Offering equipped.

8)  Muscle Belt and the Atma Weapon. If this weapon gains power with the
amount of your HP, why not have more HP?


The Best for Magic
------------------

1)  Gem Box and Offering. I've always wanted to cast two Ultima spells per 
round, and have it cost me only 2 MP!

2)  Earings and more Earings. Use this if you want some heavy magic power.

3)  Equip Relic Ring. Cast Doom on this person, and the entire party will be
completely cured!


Equipment Optimums
------------------
1)  For Gau and Mog, equip the Snow Muffler. Almost all attacks do 1 HP of
damage on you, and you're immune to Fire and Ice attacks!

2)  Mog with the Moogle Charm and Sprint Shoes.  Good for doing quick tasks.

3)  Terra with the Atma Weapon, Paladin Shield, Genji Helmet, and Genji Armor,
plus the Offering and Economizer relics. With this, you should be able to
defeat every enemy in the game by yourself. Seriously!


 
                    Desperation (Near Fatal) Attacks

Not Saving at a Point
---------------------
In places where you are controlling more than one party, such as the Phoenix
Cave and Kefka's Tower, if one party is on a save point, then all the other
parties are also considered to be standing on it and can use Tents to re-
plenish their energy!


Revivify the Undead
-------------------
Undead monsters are suceptible to Cure magic as well as items such as Life
and Revivify. Try using these items and you should beat them in no time!

SUPER PLAY-Fantasy Quest: Interview with Ted Woolsey
----------------------------------------------------
By Neil West

NOTE: Ted Woolsey is also known as Square S on America Online!
(Taken from Super Play Magazine, September 1994)

SquareSoft's main man and translator of Secret of Mana, Ted Woolsey, talks to
Super Play about life, the universe, RPGs and everything. But mainly he talks
about RPGs.

Q: Up until the release by Nintendo UK of the insanely great Secret of Mana,
   European players will only ever see the wonder of Square games by ob-
   taining gray import cartridges. Is this the start of more officially re-
   leased Square games to come, or a one-off deal purely for the launch of
   the Secret of Mana?

A: No, there are definitely more Square games planned for release in Europe. 
   This process of releasing games through other people is pretty much the
   same strategy that our parent company in Japan used when first breaking
   into the American market. They didn't set up a company here straightaway
   and market our games direct, instead they licensed the first 8-bit Final
   Fantasy game to Nintendo and eased in to the US market gradually. I'm sure
   this is the same strategy now but in Europe.

Q: So it would seem likely that SquareSoft's presence in Europe will in-
   crease, maybe until a SquareSoft Europe is established?

A: Well, that would seem sensible because the European market is very strong,
   and it looks likely that it will only increase, but I think it's too early
   to tell if there will be a Square office set up. Either way, the games 
   will keep coming though...

Q: Tell us about your relationship with Square of Japan. Do you choose which
   of their games will be translated into English, or do they tell you?

A: It's getting to the point where we do actually have a lot of control. in 
   the early days - about five years ago - titles were selected in Japan for
   American release, 'localized' [translated and re-jigged for the new aud-
   ience] and then shipped over for release. But at the end of this month,
   I'll be going over to Square in Japan to take a look at all the titles in
   development and hand-[ick which games we're going to release in the US and
   Europe over the next year.
   So more and more we're having a hand in deciding which games make it out 
   of Japan.

Q: And this responsibility will increase, right?

A: Absolutely.

Q: Things are really on a roll for Square right now. It seems that Final
   Fantasy is now a serious rival to Dragon Quest for the crown of most pop-
   ular RPG series in Japan. In America though, Enix still has a loyal 
   following. Do you think the next few releases from Square will consolidate
   your position as leader in the field? Do you feel you are in a battle with
   Enix?

A: Hmm, not really. It's funny over here in the US because role playing games
   are such a small slice of the overall videogaming pie, the following is
   still very much a minority of gameplayers. Our research has that if some-
   one has a positive experience playing a role playing title, then they want
   more. So people who like, say, a Dragon Warrior title seem to like Square-
   Soft titles as well. I know that there are big sales battles going on in
   Japan between Square and Enix, and I think that they actually have some
   sort of agreement not to go head-to-head with the release of similar ti-
   tles and to make sure that both Square and Enix have enough space, but
   over here in the US it's a whole lot more relaxed.
   Over here I really don't think that it's a negative thing to have two very
   strong RPG lines.

Q: You're saying that yourselves and Enix are actually doing each other fav-
   ors: making sure that RPG fans have a decent supply of quality titles en-
   abling the genre to grow and gain more support?

A: Yeah, absolutely.

Q: Do you take much notice of releases from other companies, and follow gam-
   ing trends? Or does Square stick to its own guns and try not to be swayed
   by current trends?

A: No, no - in this day and age it's impossible to shut your eyes and ignore
   what's going on around you. We're very careful to look and watch what's
   coming out and when stuff's being released also.

Q: On a scale of one to ten, how tough is it to translate Japanese games into
   English?
   
A: Let me put it this way, It's a lot more difficult than it seems! Our avid 
   following in the US is constantly saying to us, 'look, just what is your 
   problem? Get the games out faster!', they have a real problem with this.
   But they don't understand that there are severe limitations - as everyone
   who's played a Square game will realize - with size, it's just so tough
   squeezing the translated text intothe game. What this means is that you
   have to rethink an entire plot without actually changing any of the par-
   ameters that govern how the plot has implications on the rest of the game.
   So, inevitably, some depth is lost in the translation from Japanese to
   English.

Q: How much is lost?

A: Well, as far as simple text is concerned, I would say that you can get 
   twice as much information into the same space when written in Japanese as
   you can writing in English. But it's the process of making sure that what
   you're left with still makes complete sense, that's the real time consuming
   problem, even after you've stretched and pulled all the text windows until
   they are as big as possible. Also, with some titles - like the Secret of
   Mana - there's no order to the messages. As a result, it's very difficult
   keeping all the plot lines and story elements in your head while working
   out what can be lost and what needs to be changed.
   Translating Japanese can be a completely frustrating task!

Q: Aside from the basic difference in languages, do you experience a lot of
   problems when you're dealing with distinctly Japanese cultural points or
   cultural references?

A: Oh yes. And a lot of the problem lies with the basic expectations of the
   gameplayer. Japanese RPGs come from a textual background; from short stor-
   ies, Manga and novels. In Japanese literature, typically, the need for a
   strong beginning, middle, and end is not that great. The Japanese tend to
   savor the episodic elements of an adventure; brief jaunts off on side-
   quests which bear no relation to the main game are welcomed in Japan, but
   here in the US - and I guess in Europe too - players tend to react like
   'Now what was all that for? What a waste of time!'. So in some ways it's
   difficult to translate a game that was designed for the Japanese market
   because the gameplayers themselves are very different - it's not just that
   they speak a different language.

Q: So how do you deal with this kind of problem? Do you have the facilities
   in the US to restructure a game to suit tastes outside of Japan?

A: Well we have the know-how - that's not a problem - but we're really up
   against tough time constraints. In a perfect world, we would take the
   beautiful graphics we get from Japan and completely dump all of the code 
   that stipulates when an event has to happen and how it occurs. We would
   go back in and tailor it to the audience here.
   But back in the real world, we simply don't have the time or resources to
   do this. We have to take it exactly as it comes and simply dump the English
   translation into the original game.

Q: So you'd still keep the graphics?

A: Oh yes! While the actual game code may be in no way superior to stuff 
   generated in America or Europe, the Japanese do have a beautiful sense of
   style and I think the games (esspecially Final Fantasy III, which is FFVI
   in Japan) are absolutely beautiful with scanned images overlaid on built-
   up graphics.

Q: So how do you go about actually translating a game? What process is in-
   volved?

A: I was given just 30 days to translate the Secret of Mana text. This meant
   that I had to fly out to Japan for a month with my wife and kids and just
   get on with translating the original scripts practically just as soon as
   they were completed. There's really no time to do justice to these games.

Q: So do you normally wait until a game is finished before starting on the 
   translation or work side-by-side with the people writing the original 
   storyline?

A: No, I usually wait for a finished product and that's because if I jump in
   and start taking on text before the game is finished, there will inevit-
   ably be so many - countless - revisions and rewrites of the original,
   that my translation becomes out of date practically as soon as I've comp-
   leted it. The people who write these games work right until the last min-
   ute to hone the text to perfection, and as the text changes then so does
   the graphics, the timing of animated sequences and indeed the storyline.
   So it really does pay to wait until the game is done and then jump in and 
   get on with it.

Q: How do you coordinate dialouge with hundreds of different characters?

A: I play the finished Japanese version about three times then, having video-
   taped all the appearances of characters, I'll sit down and work out a
   translation that seems to work in English but will also work with all the
   original Japanese source code. Then, if there's time, I can start adapting
   the game to more non-Japanese tastes.

Q: Secret of Mana's wide appeal might be put down to its action-based combat,
   players don't have to worry too much about weapon stats and the like if
   they don't want to. Many older gamers prefer turn-based combat, however,
   and the slower, more involved plots. Which do you favor? Are there more
   action RPGs on the way from Square?

A: Well, Secret of Mana 2 will be an action/adventure title as will our first
   US-developed game; both of which are currently in development. This US
   game is being done by Americans, for Americans, so it would seem logical
   that it will follow the more popular action/adventure format.
   In regards to which is the better system...
   Well, there are maniacal players of the command-driven RPGs and these 
   people will dabble in action games, such as Zelda, but they always actual-
   ly prefer the slower-paced, more strategic traditional games. We receive
   telephone calls from strange people many years after a game was released,
   calling to find out if the game hero ever got married! Now those are real
   maniacal players.
   The action/adventure players, however, are larger in numbers and the demo-
   graphic is different. they tend to be younger and like the idea of jump-
   ing straight into the action with a sword in their hands; it's an empower-
   ment issue - you get to go out there, start whacking things and it feels
   good!
   With the more traditional RPGs, it takes a good 15 or 20 hours of playing
   before you're finally hooked.

Q: So I guess there's always a compromise to be faced when putting a game
   interface together or designing a combat system.Do you appease the diehard 
   fans who like to 'go deep,' or make the game more accessible to a larger
   audience?

A: Exactly. It's definately a trade-off and it's a tough one. But I think the
   Secret of Mana went a long way into bringing more RPGs into the mix than
   perhaps, say, Zelda which is more predominantly a straightforward action
   game.

Q: You must be very pleased with the reception of Secret of Mana. This game
   has caused jaded reviewers to blub with joy, with it's sumptuous graphics
   and perhaps the greatest musical score of any Super NES game ever. Did
   you know it was going to be such a success?

A: Well, no - there;s an interesting story here in that Secret of Mana was
   originally scheduled as a CD game for the Sony CD-ROM SNES add-on that
   never appeared. So it probably would have been much longer, and I think
   that when you play it you can get a sense of areas where it seems that
   something might be missing... But the team working on it turned it back
   into a cartridge game and I think they did a wonderful job; certainly
   the graphics speak for themselves.
   But as to whether we knew it was going to be a success, well no. In Japan
   the game certainly didn't sell very well up against the Final Fantasy
   Series (which was in its sixth iteration, whereas Secret of Mana was
   starting off with no momentum) sono one was expecting the runaway hit
   that it's turned out to be.

Q: Is there anything missing from the English version?

A: No, just some things have been altered for sake of space.

Q: Final Fantasy VI is going to be released as FFIII in the US, with FFV 
   being held over 'till 1995 to be released as a seperate game. Could you
   explain this decision, and tell us about the games themselves?

A: The Final Fantasy series basically has two seperate tracks: the odd series
   (FFI, FFIII, and FFV) are controller command drive games, whereas the
   even series are more story line driven games. As for FFV though, well
   although we're sure it's a great title it hasn't been a hit with too many
   people in out focus groups, although the more experienced gamers loved
   the complex character building - it's just not accessible enough to the
   average gamer. But we're determined we want to release it so we're going
   to wait and introduce it once there's a larger audience for it's partic-
   ular style. Hence the wait.

Q: Is there a finalized name for FFV yet?

A: The tentative, working title at the moment is 'Final Fantasy Extreme'.
   But this could always change...

Q: FFII also had some changes (we've heard rumors about dancers stripping
   off in the original!). Tell us about those, go on.

A: Well, there's a level of playfulness and - dare I say - sexuality in
   Japanese games that just doesn't exist here [in the USA], basically
   because of Nintendo of America's rules and guidelines. And this includes
   little characters that take their clothes off, or show their bottoms or
   chests - that Nintendo won't allow over here. I guess the aesthetic in
   Japan is perhaps similar to that found in say France or Germany, where
   you might see more people nude sunbathing or - in magazines perhaps -
   see more 'anatomical' shots. I mean, in the original there was nothing 
   shocking - there was no sex or anything - but what there was Nintendo 
   didn't like so we had to remove it.

Q: Maybe the new, more lenient Nintendo would now allow this...

A: Yes, it's certainly possible that in the future there will be a completely
   uncut version released.

Q: Square has picked up Capcom's Breath of Fire for translation and a US re-
   lease is planned for August of this year. What prompted you to make this
   move?

A: Actually, Capcom approached us. they had a very busy schedule (that in-
   cluded at least two RPGs) so they simply didn't have room for it. And we
   loved it, and knew it to be something out audience was dying for...

Q: What about Romancing SaGa 2? Have you any plans to translate this? It did
   remarkably well in Japan, and its simalarities to the FF series would make 
   it extremely popular with fans of those games...

A: Oh yeah, I'm sure it would be great but unfortunately it all comes down to
   a manpower issue and we really don't have the resources to do it. For
   every person put onto the job of restructuring a game for an English
   translation it means one taken off the development of FFVII or Secret of
   Mana 2. So no, unfortuneately, I can't see the Romancing SaGa series mak-
   ing it over here.

Q: A new 16 mes RPG called Live A Live is shortly to be released in Japan.
   Have you any plans to bring this over too? We understand that it contains
   a little strategy game called Captain Square, and few strategy games have
   made it to the West.

A: Oh, yes this is a great game. It's been designed by one of the teams be-
   hind Hanjuku Hero from a couple years ago and it's basically seven games 
   crammed onto one 16 Meg cart - so each are graphically quite simple, but
   great games.
   The trouble is that up against Mortal kombat, for example, gamers really 
   demand more visual sophistication - so it's fairly doubtful taht we could
   ever sell enough to get our money back.

Q: That's a shame. Maybe one day the audience will be big ebough to make it
   worth while. Just one last thing: the faces that appear in the backgrounds
   of a lot of your games - what are they all about, is there a hidden mess-
   age here?

A: Everyone seems curious about the faces! But no, there's no hidden meaning,
   satanic messages or anything - I guess it's just our artists' sense of
   bizarre humor coming to the fore. Actually, in one of the deep dungeons,
   in FFII there was a room that contained the entire programming team. un-
   fortuneately that was one thing that just didn't make it across to the
   US version. Nintendo didn't seem to appreciate it.

Spoilsports. Well, here's wishing you the best of luck with your future
titles Ted, and pick out some good ones for us when you visit Japan. Thanks
very much for your time.

EGM-Final Fantasy III Interview with Yusuke Hirata
--------------------------------------------------
By Nob

(Taken from the October 1994 issue of EGM)

EGM's Nob (our ace editor in Japan) arranged a special interview with
Mr. Yusuke Hirata, the general manager of the publicity department of
Square Co, Ltd.

Q: In Japan, you have already released six official Final Fantasy games.
   When were these released and how well did they sell?

A: The original FF was launched in December 1987. Approximately 600,000
   were sold in Japan. The NES version sold better, registering slaes of 
   approximately 700,000. The Famicom FF2 and FF3 were respectively launched
   in December 1988 and April 1990. Their sales were approximately 800,000
   and 1.4 million units respectively. These were never translated. Final
   Fantasy IV, our first Super Famicom RPG, registered sales of approximately
   1.5 million upon its release in July 1990. FFIV was translated as the 
   Super NES FF2 which sold about 300,000 units. FFV was released at the end
   of 1992 and has sold approximately 2.4 million units. The newest title, 
   FFVI, was released in April of this year. It has become our biggest hit
   ever, with sales reaching approximately 2.55 million units. We hope the
   Super NES FF3 will echo the success of FFVI in America. In total, the 
   entire FF series has registered sales of approximately 9.25 million units
   in Japan and 2.2 million units overseas, so close to 11.5 million units
   all told.
   Incidentally, we also repackaged FF1 and 2 together onto a single Famicom
   cartridge earlier this year in Japan.

Q: Besides the official titles, are there so-called Gaiden (side story) games
   that have spun off from the series? The Super NES FF Mystic Quest comes to
   mind.

A: The Game Boy Seiken Densetsu (Legend of the Holy Sword) was subtitled FF
   Gaiden in Japan, and called Final Fantasy Legend overseas. About 700,000
   units were sold in all, with about half a million being sold in Japan. Its
   sequel, Seiken Densetsu 2, came out for the SFC last year. You might know
   it better as Secret of Mana! It has almost gone doublr Platinum.
   Mystic Quest was released in America long before the Japanese version was
   translated from it. All told, it sold approximately 800,000 units, 50-50
   between the SFC and Super NES versions.

Q: Do you plan to make any other Gaiden-type games?

A: Nothing has been decided.

Q: Is there any plan to release the yet untranslated FF games? Although it 
   may be difficult to do the 8-bit FF2 and FF3 because of the market con-
   ditions, it would be a shame if American gamers couldn't experience the
   outstanding FFV.

A: At present, we haven't come to any decisions.

Q: FFVI is widely hailed as the best ever in the series. Will the Super NES
   version be altered in any way from the SFC version other than translating
   the text? For example, the Super NES FF2 was made considerably simpler to
   play than the original SFC FFIV. Will such balance adjustments be made?

A: We haven't made particularly noteworthy changes. We feel that the game
   has been designed to enable virtually all gamers to adjust configurations
   to suit their playing styles.

Q: Including planning, how long did FFVI take to produce?

A: We spent about a year and a half.

Q: How many people were involved in the game's production?

A: In total, about 30. There are five planners, five programmers, ten graphic
   artists, and two music people. The rest are assistants.

Q: Are development teams always composed of identical members? Or do key
   people assemble seperate development teams for each title?

A: We assemble a new team for each title. However, the main people remain
   constant including our vice president, Hironobu Sakaguchi, who is the 
   driving force behind the series.

Q: We are always astounded by the superb music in FF games. Who is the
   composer?

A: The man responsible for all the FF music is Nobuo Uenatsu, our resident
   maestro.

Q: In Japan, the soundtracks of FF titles are available on CD. How big is the 
   lineup? Are these music CDs popular?

A: CDs of all original soundtracks have been released for the FF series ti-
   tles. Besides these, arranged versions based on the original soundtracks
   such as orchestral arrangements have also been released for every title.
   The 3-CD FFVI original soundtrack has been our biggest seller to date with
   sales topping 200,000 units.

Q: The evolution of game systems has been amazing. Are system improvements
   based on feedback from fans to a certain extent?

A: All system enhancements and features are based on the original ideas of
   our development staff.

Q: FFVI appears to have established an incredibly high standard of quality.
   Although it is premature, can FFVII keep up the series tradition of best-
   ing the game before it?

A: Our development staff upholds a policy of always using the best techniques
   available at the time. Each development team therefore aims to make a game
   that's better than the one before it.

Q: In Japan, an FF anime series was produced. Which game is the story based
   on? Will it be released in America?

A: The story is set in the world of FFV, but 150 years later. We are present-
   ly considering releasing it in America.

Q: Is there any possibility of seeing FF titles on the Ultra 64 and/or other
   next generation systems?

A: We are evaluating possibilities. On a purely hypothetical level, we think
   that the odds are slightly better for Ultra 64 than other new game sys-
   tems.

Q: Finally, how about a few words for the Square fans in America?

A: We will stand by our policy of consistently making games that betray your
   expectations for the better. Count on us for games that will make you go,
   "Wow!"

                             PART SIX-Rumors
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
By Wizard 201

There are currently several rumors out there about different characters and
items that are supposed to be 'TOP SECRET' Items that Square has hidden deep
within Final Fantasy Three, most of the rumors are very absurd, but here are
the best of those that have at least some type of merit or at least are
mildly possible:

1. General Leo is the hot topic for rumors now in the FF folders. There is
   a rumor that you can bring him back to life with a potion called the
   'Ressurect Potion.' You can get it from a Gold Dragon on the big island
   (the one with trees on it) north-east of Gau's father's house. Whether
   this is true or not, I have no idea. King Kung as well as another person
   who he knows on Prodigy is supposed to have fought the Gold Dragon. King
   Kung did not get the potion when he fought the dragon, but he reports
   that the other person did, and revived Leo with it. King Kung and I have
   no proof that this is true. I might be able to prove this is true when
   I get a picture in the mail from a member of AOL (whose identity I will
   keep secret). He says that his friend found Leo, and he will take a pic-
   ture and send it to me in the mail. If it is authentic, then the Leo rumor
   will be true, but don't get your hopes up, there is a great possibility
   that this person could be lying.

2. Kappa the Imp is another greatly discussed character. There is a rumor 
   that he might be able to join your party. For those who don't remember,
   Kappa was the little Imp guy who talked to you after you got Gau from
   the Veldt. This very well might be since there are many Imp items such
   as the Imp Halberd and the Imp's Armor. But still, this is only a rumor.

3. Siegfried is the last of the 'More Secret Characters' rumors. It is said
   that you can get him in the Colesseum, but no one seems to know how. There
   are also rumors of weapons that no one can equip out of all the fourteen
   characters (that's Umaro and Gogo included). Still a rumor, but a very
   interesting possibility.

4. The Marshe Claw was rumored to be a super powerful weapon that only Sabin
   could equip, but so far, I have seen no existence of such a weapon.

5. The Gamma Sword was rumored to be an even more powerful sword than that
   of the Atma Weapon or Illumina Sword! It's said that if you circle Kefka's
   Tower in the airship, that when Doom Gaze is supposed to attack you, a
   Behemoth will attack you instead. When you defeated the Behemoth, you were
   supposed to get the Gamma Sword. Well, I know that this seems reasonable,
   but I seem to remember someone saying Doom Gaze was hovering over a certain
   area in the world, which was around the area of the Veldt. If that's
   true (I think it is) then Doom Gaze could never attack you when you're
   circling Kefka's Tower. And, in all the times I've encountered Doom Gaze,
   he's never attacked me anywhere but that region. Sorry Folks!

Well, that's about it for thr rumors section; just remember to count your
extra spaces* before you make any judgements!



* extra spaces - there are two extra spaces in the character selection
                 screen that are not filled when you have all fourteen
                 characters; this implies that there might be another,
                 if not two other, characters!
