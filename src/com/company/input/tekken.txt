(NOTE:  V.1 consists of the Tekken moves sheet that Namco released.)


     Towards the end of the 20th century, a mysterious challenge went out
to all who were deserving.  No one knows from where it originated, but
it's draw was irresistible.  The promise of power and riches beyond those
attainable by the common man all to go to the survivor.  From the depths
of the lower earth to the far reaches of the outlands the call escaped no
one.  Many perished during the mortal street fights that were only a
preview of the challenges that were to come.  Only 8? remain, those with
the true killer instinct, all ready to die, to gain the title of "TEKKEN",
"Lord of the Rave War."


     Tekken is Namco's latest stab at a combat game.  Its graphics and
playability are much like Virtua Fighting.  The controls conist of a
joystick and four buttons.
