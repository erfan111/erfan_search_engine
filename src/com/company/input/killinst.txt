Hello all, and welcome to the Killer Instinct FAQ. 
Because I do not play SFII... but do play MK, I will try to explain
everything as if you haven't played either.
The game is a Mortal Kombat/Virtual Fighter/Street Fighter type game with
graphics that blow em all away. My only current complaint is that it seems
impossible to block combo moves, and this gets you killed way too quick for
50 cents. (IMHO)

Sorry for the big delay I have been swamped. There is some new stuff in   
here as well as another format change.(last one I, really!)

See the misc section for release date stuff!

**********
* Rounds *
**********

Each player starts with 2 bars of energy to use for the entire game.
(Think of it as one LARGE bar but only half is shown onscreen at a time.)
Once the first bar is gone, the player falls, gets up and starts to use the
second bar of energy. The player who wins the first round gets to keep their
remaining energy plus still has the second bar to use. This makes it more
fair to the person who wins the first round.  So, if you weren't paying
attention, and lost big time the first round... chances are very slim for a
come-back! 

Last Breath: This allows you one last chance for life. You get enough
energy to take one more hit! I have one matches using this, and really
upset some people! After the voice says 'No Mercy' start rotating your
stick and maching buttons, you guy will get back up and start to fight 
again! You MUST do this before the other person start's doing the no mercy!
If you were the winning person and do not want your opponent to come back
with his 'Last Breath' you must just hit them again, and forget about the 
no mercy!

**********
* Combos *
**********

A combo is a consecutive series of hits (punches/kicks/specialty moves)
without your opponent being able to retaliate.  These are not all confirmed
and don't work all the time.  I did see Orchid do a Combo Breaker. I don't
know how, she just did her Helicopter Kick, and the guy flew back.
Each characters combos are discussed in detail on their page of the FAQ.
They've given each combo a "name" and when you complete one the game will
flash it up on the screen (similar to PR) and speak it, like "Hyper Combo"!

The combo "names are as follows:

	 3 Hits: Triple
	 4 Hits: Super
	 5 Hits: Hyper
	 6 Hits: Brutal
	 7 Hits: Master
	 8 Hits: Awesome
	 9 Hits: King
	10 Hits: Monster
	20 Hits: Ultra!   

And they go on......

**********************
* Ultimate Victories *
**********************

If you win without losing your first bar of energy it is considered an 
"Ultimate Victory" and the character gets a close up animation!
These animations are described in each character's section of the FAQ.

**************
* NO MERCY'S *
**************

More commonly known as fatalities......
When you defeat your opponent the computer yells "NO MERCY" and that is 
your chance to kill him. (i.e. Finish HIM! from MK)  These "No Mercy's"
are also described in each character's section of the FAQ.  

**********
* STAGES *
**********

Each game is played on a different stage.  Each with its own background
picture, music.  The players cannot pick which stage to play on , it's
randomly selected by the game.  The current stages are as follows...

- Canyon

In this stage you are fighting on a rope/log bridge with a huge rock
canyon in the background.  An interesting effect is that the bridge kinda
bounces when you jump on it. The setting sun has the sky turned blazing red
and the clouds are streaming towards you like mad. The music for this
stage has sort of an American Indian sound to it, with the chanting etc.
The main thing to remember on this stage is to avoid being trapped on
either end of the bridge since this puts you higher than your opponent and
at a serious fighting disadvantage!

- City Rooftop

This stage has you on the rooftop of a skyscraper in a futuristic city at 
night.  In the background there are various other buildings with flashing
red beacons.  There are also two billboards, one showing an animated
Ultra 64 logo and the other showing a realtime scaled down version of your
current fight!  There is no high or low ground on this stage, but being
trapped in a corner can be pretty damaging.  Although the roof looks alot
like the ring used in Virtual Fighter you CANNOT knock your opponent off
the roof, they merely get cornered.  

- Castle Rooftop

Similar to the City Rooftop scene but in this one you are set in more of a
medieval time.  Sort of a Transylvania feel to it, with bats flying around
and lightning flashing....even has a full moon!  Again, no high or low
ground but watch those corners. And again, you cannot be knocked off the
roof.

- Boxing Gym

This one has you in a boxing workout gym with a boxing ring in the
background and large punching bags hanging down.  This is one of the cooler
scenes cause as you and your opponent move back and forth the perspective of
the scene changes and you can really see the 3-D effect with the punching
bags and all. 

- Alleyway

Wow we're out on the streets, fighting amongst the broken down cars and
graffiti covered buildings!  This scene is also on of the better ones for
seeing the 3-D effect of the perspective changes, particularly in the cars
in the background.  The music here has lots of police sirens going in it.

- Chateau

Here you are fighting in a nice cozy little room with a fire going in the
fireplace and classic paintings hanging on the walls.  Rich maroon velvet
drapes and gold chandeliers add to the feel of the room.  There is a large
wooden door to the far right and stairs leading upwards to the left.
Don't get forced onto the stairs, this puts you on higher ground and
therefore at a disadvantage.

_/                              Controls                                  _/
_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/

Your character is controlled using 6 buttons and 1 joystick.
The top row of buttons are high attacks/punchs and the row bottom are low 
attacks/kicks. To keep the move list simple I will use the numbers 1-6 to
represent button presses. Below is the map. 

		1  2  3

		4  5  6

If you have played the SF games then the buttons are:
1 = Jab Punch	2 = Middle Punch	3 = Fierce Punch
4 = Jab Kick	5 = Middle Kick	        6 = Fierce Kick

Pull Back (away from opponent) to block.

To explain joystick movements I will use the following:

F = Forward	B = back	D = Down	U = Up

QCT= quarter circle towards	QCB = quarter circle back

HCT = half circle towards	HCB = half circle back

I've found that not all moves are quarter or half circle. 
There are moves that seem to require a 3/4 circle from back to top.
For these I will use 3/4CF. (for 3/4 circle forward, from back to top)

Almost all the characters have a move using QCT and Punch, I just do not
know exactly what they all do. (yet)

Almost all moves that start off with Back need to charge for a few seconds!

Moves with * in front of them have not yet been confirmed by myself, or more
than one person. As I try them, or anyone else (besides the person who gives
them to me in the first place)says they worked I will take off the *. I am
not saying I don't trust people..., I just don't want to get flamed by
people saying "Your FAQ says this, and it doesn't work, and I lost,and..."
So let me know if you can confirm a move!

**********
* Rumors *
**********

Jago will NOT be in the final release.
The game was designed in Europe, and just created here.
Glacius has 3 No Mercy's.
The game is on a hard drive... well almost.
I have been told, to make updates easier, currently it's on a CD rom.
This explains the delays at the beginning of play.
And yes it will change, before it's released!
There will be 14 total stages in the final release!

********
* Bugs *
********

Since nobody (at a certain game company) wants to say what version the
current one is, I don't know what bugs are in what version.

Sometimes when on the roof stage, a player will get knocked into the air
with the camera angle from above looking down.  The camera is about 50 feet
in the air, and there is NO body floating around up there.  All you see is
the one person still on the ground.  If the person on the ground is Chief
Thunder, he can keep doing the Flying Head Butt, and keep this invisible
body in the air!

Also if you get stuck in the corner... and the Chief keeps headbutting 
you into the air... your stuck till you die.(and then some)

Not known, but most likely a hardware bug that is also in SOME MK II
machines, nobody will be able to move. The characters just stand there.
If you hit the machine (near the joystick's) this will free them up.

Not all 'No Mercy's' work on all characters. Either the animation for these
are not completed, or you must use a different 'No Mercy' on that person.

********
* Misc *
********

Release Dates:(yea) The game is being made slowly, and is being shipped to
 all the BIG aracdes, and will go into super mass shipping by DEC 1st. So
All the little arcade everywhere will start to see it then!

Appologies for the lack of descriptions, like I said before I have been
swamped. Version 3.1 of this (hopefully out next week!) will be much more
descriptive. I just needed to get the format change done, and a few new
additions!

If anyone can fill in the blanks let me know! I am in touch with a Midway
rep... Hopefully we will get some inside info. 

This FAQ is also available by FTP, courtesy of GamePro magazine's Andy Eddy.
Just FTP to netcom.com and cd /pub/vi/vidgames/faqs.  Hopefully the latest
version will always be here.  So if your in doubt about which version you
have, give this place a try. 

Hopefully the list of places to get this faq will grow. If you have a FAQ
site, let me know! It will be on Karl Czapla's site, but I don't have the
info how to access it. (sorry, next time!)

The latest version will also be in the rec.games.video.arcade news!

It will only hurt relations!  If you have some big questions ask me, and I
