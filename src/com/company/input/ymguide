PASSCODES (ruins? runes?)

    R = R button on top of controller
    L = L button on top of controller
    v = Down  on directional pad of controller
    ^ = Up    on directional pad of controller

    *NOTE*  May not all be tested.  Since my hand writting is poor I
            may have typed these in wrong.  If one doesn't work, try
            replacing a Y with a v  (My Y and down arrow are similar
            looking) or R and B, or vice versa.

HEART CONTAINERS

  There are supposedly 16 Heart containers.  I finished the game missing
  one. I know the location of 15, one of which I (previously) couldn't
  get to. Most of them are laying out in the open or presented after
  beating a boss, thorough walking around each area will yield them. 
  Their locations are included below  ( Two are found while riding the
  mine carts, directions to those two are given in the next session):

    0. Start with 3
    1. After first meanie tree.
    2. In the meadow before the Pig boss
    3. Before entrance to mine shaft
    4. Inside mine shaft, toward far left area (through walk through wall)
    5. Inside mine shaft, toward lower left area.  Walk through wall, then
       float up ladder.
    6. Top right corner of hedge maze
    7. Upper right area while under water
    8. middle left area while under water (below second exit).
    9. Room above first room at entrance to dungeon
   10. in lower right area of first ant hole
   11. Right after dragon boss
   12. On tracks after dragon boss

  Mystery Heart Question answered (the one I previously couldn't get to
  number 9 above):

    (From SALGARDNER@delphi.com)

    I know how to get the last heart that you said you missed. Found it
    when cruising thru old Nintendo mag while searching for hints. Move one
    of the pillars so you can walk over by the upper wall in the corner.
    Use the balloon to rise up to what is actually an upper floor. Get
    heart and climb down. I thought this was a bit unfair and unobvious.
    Never would have got it w/o the mag.


MINE CART TRACKS

  Track 1 (1 heart container, 1 exit)

    To the heart container (from start):

      start  ( headed in this direction <- )
      down   ( obviously )
      2nd right
      2nd down
      1st right
          straight
      1st down
      1st left
      1st up
      1st right
          straight
      1st down
      1st right
      straight   = Heart conatiner

    To exit of Mine (from start):

      start  ( headed in this direction <- )
      down   ( obviously )
      2nd right
      1st down
      1st right
      1st down
      1st left
      1st up
      1st left?
      1st down
      1st right
          straight
      2nd up  = end
      

  Track 2 (1 exit)

    I didn't write these down, since it was rather short/straight forward,
    anyone?

  Track 3 (1 heart container, 1 exit)

    Each rubber ball disappears after you beat 1 boss.  First you have
    to beat the spider, then the pig thing, then gloop, then the
    Shadow King

    Here are some directions:

    To the heart container:  (From start)
      start  ( headed in this direction -> )
      turn down  (headed down)
      turn at the second right, almost at the bottom of the room  (head ->)
      turn up (headed up)
      at top of room, head right  ->
      turn down on last possible track
      ride through wall at bottom for container ( you will auto
                                                  turn a couple times)

    To spider:  (From start, This is the hardest one I think)
      start  ( headed in this direction -> )
      turn down  (headed down)
      turn at first left  (  <--  )
      turn up
      turn at last right (might be an auto turn)
      turn at first up (I'm not certain it is the first up, but it is
                        after crossing  a track or two)
      turn at first left (I think it is the only left, the tracks end if you
                           go too far)
      bounce off the ball (the room behind this ball leads to gloop) -->
      go down (to where you came from )
      turn left at the very bottom of room
      this should lead to the spider room

    From spider to pig thing:
      start (from spider room) -->
      go up
      turn left or right and use one of the balls to reverse direction and go
           back down.
      turn left, let the auto turns take you the next room.

    You should be able to find the last two balls now since you have been
    every where else,  just reverse the directions to get to the other rooms.


BOSSES

  SPIDER 1 (similar to SPIDER 2)

    Freeze the nest, then shoot it with the star.  In general I just
    repeated the following three steps:

     - put a decoy in front of the spider (to attract the little guys)
     - use the snow flake while in front of the nest
     - fire on the nest with the star
     - repeat as nessecary.

  GLOOP 2

    I got past gloop.  Use your mirror to distract him while he is hopping
    around.  As soon as he breaks up, place a decoy and step within range
    of the decoy.  switch your item to the stun dust.  alternate Y and
    B to stun/shoot.  This is all you have to do.  stun, shoot, stun, shoot,
    etc.

  SHADOW KING 2 (Courtesy of spordon@nyx10.cs.du.edu (Steve Pordon (Legion))
    
    Thanks for your help getting to the Shadow King. Here's how to beat him:
    
    Have the comb and the torch weapon ready when you enter his room. When
    he starts to attack with the flying eyeballs, just walk around avoiding
    them and torch them when you can.

    Then when he sends the time bombs toward you, start tapping 'Y' to comb
    your hair. What happens is the bombs wait for you to stop combing, then
    explode, but if you hit the button fast enough you will be invincible
    when they explode. You shouldn't take more than about 1 full heart of
    damage.  (NOTE:  You can use the invincibility water here, just stand
    close to the Shadow King and it will last through all the bomb guys)

    When he throws the darkness at you, just use the torch. this will light
    the area immediately. I think you have to have the torch in your hand
    before the darkness for it to work.

    Then he throws the electrical orbs at you -- use the mirror, which will
    attract the orbs. Now comes the easy part.
    
    Get the hourglass ready. Stand toward the center of the floor, but where
    you can see the King when he is on your right in the lava. Right when he
    starts to jump, freeze time. Then run to the left where the princess is
    locked into an orb. Get your silver stars ready and hit the orb a couple
    of times. She'll pop out and give you a golden amulet. Stop time again
    and run back to the right, and get the amulet ready. Avoid the shadow
    king and use the amulet when he lands. The amulet needs time to recharge
    between attacks, so use the hourglass a few times after you use the
    amulet, and it will recharge in time for the next attack by the king.
