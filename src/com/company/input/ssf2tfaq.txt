********well, it's back********

Man, just when I thought I didn't have to update this thing
anymore, someting big & new pops up! %O

Okay, so the last version WASN'T the final version.  Hey,
how many of you saw this Akuma thing coming? I sure as hell didn't.
And since this is supposed to be a Frequently Asked Questions guide,
it's my duty to update it.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
                   PART 1: REGARDING SUPER COMBOS
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
- A super combo (SC) is a move that inflicts from 40% to 60% damage.
  It's primary trademark is that the attack leaves a trail of shadows
  and it is begun when your character lets off a spark of light in his/her
  eye.  The game pauses for a slight moment when you execute your
  Super Combo.
- Super Combos can only be done when the Super Combo Meter (seen at
  bottom corner of screen) is full.  The Super Combo Meter (SCM)
  increases after the following:
  * You execute any special move
  * You strike (blocked or not blocked, it matters not) your opponent
    with any regular move.
- The more powerful the move/hit, the quicker the SCM rises.
- The SC's have the ability to "bounce" characters in the air (a la MK).
  Especially Bison's, Dhalsim's, Ken's, and Sagat's more so than others.
  Balrog's SC still can hit airborne opponents up to five times.
  This is known as the "Volleyball Effect" (VE) which is explained in
  section 7.
- SC's are "combo"-able with regular moves and can dizzy opponents.
- Vega's, T-hawk's and 'Gief's SC's do NOT lose their charge if you
  attempt and fail to do them. The charge only dies if you actually LAND
  the SC. (this is kinda obvious, as their SC's are all THROWS, but hey,
  it's worth a mention).
- The following have SC's that can go through fireballs, but the timing for
  it is somewhat precise (i.e. if you time it wrong, you WON'T be able to
  cut through fireballs, certain frames of animation are able to cut
  through fireballs, but not all frames)
   * Chun Li: more difficult to time
   * Honda: vunerable at the beginning, but cuts through easy during flight
   * Blanka: the superball, in it's later frames, rolls under "small"
     fireballs (i.e. sonic boom, yoga flame, air slasher, high tiger shot)
   * Ken: rather easily
   * Fei Long:
   * Dee Jay: more difficult to time
   * Cammy:
   * Sagat: rather easily
   * Balrog: never been stopped by a fireball before
   * Bison: never been stopped by a fireball before
   * Ryu: destroys other fireballs in it's path and STILL travels towards
     the target. In reality, his "Vacuum Fireball" is several fireballs
     compacted into a very small area, so even if your opponent is
     airborne, he will get hit several times. His feet may be invulnerable
     during the SC.  FIVE hits is the maximum number of hits Ryu's
     SC can do if it connects.
- The exact frames where the SC's are immune to fireballs vary from
  character to character. Bison's and Balrog's cut through fairly easy
  while Chun Li's and Dee Jay's have just a little more difficulty in going
  through. Different timing for each character.
- CHUN LI AND HONDA share a particular trait, and perhaps T-Hawk as well.
  Do the stick motion for the SC first, then keep your stick in a foward
  position, any forward position, don't change directions.  Your
  Super Combo will be set to go off, and all you need to do is tap the
  appropriate button.   Yes, this is a bug.

    -----------------------------
    Part 1.1 Maximum Hit & Damage
    -----------------------------
  Maximum Damage:
       * Zangief & T-Hawk will on average take off 50-60%
         Vega will usually take off 30-45%
       * Assuming that you get all possible hits in the Super Combo:
         Everyone else has a potential damage range from 25 - 55%,
         I've seen some cases where Ryu's SC connects and takes
         off little damage, so basically if the CPU gets moody as it
         often does, your SC damage will waver from high to low
         damage at moments you won't be able to predict.
  Maximum Hits:
     The best way to get the maximum # of hits is to have your
     opponent be as close as possible and on the ground.
        Ryu: 5          Guile: 6
        Ken: 5          Dhalsim: 5
        Blanka:  4      Honda: 5
        Chun Li: 6      Zangief: n/a
        Dee Jay: 4      Cammy: 5
        Fei Long: 5     T-Hawk: n/a
        Balrog: 5       Vega: n/a
        Sagat: 5        Bison: 4

    ---------------------------------
    Part 1.2:  Super Combos in Combos
    ---------------------------------

Super Combos can be added into combos.  I'd advise you to find your own,
as individual creativity is what works best when making combos,
but I'll put down some obvious ones.

Chun Li:  Jumping Fierce - SC - triple air kick
          air jab (anything?) - standing jab - SC - triple air kick
Ken:  Jumping Fierce - SC
Cammy:  Jumping fierce - SC
Sagat: Jumping fierce - SC
Dee Jay:  hm... there was this really nasty one, about 11 hits... 
          offhand I can't remember it but it went something like...
      Neck Forward Kick - crouching jab X 2-3 - Jack Knife Maximum (air kick)
      - SC - Jack Knife Maximum.

    -----------------------------------
    Part 1.3:  Charging up the SC meter
    -----------------------------------
    (creds to Mr. Chang (actually, these are his direct words
     or actually Gamest Magazine)

 o  To give a measure for the Super Meter, Gamest uses the term "dot" as in
   pixels on the screen.  I'd prefer using the word "pixel" personally,
   but hey, "dot" is shorter to type. -_^

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
                         PART 2: THE NEW THROW SYSTEM
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

NOTE: if you choose to use the SSF2 version of your character, you CANNOT
      do this. You MUST choose the SSF2T version of your character to do
      this.
If you get thrown, you can reduce the damage in half or sometimes less
        and land on your feet.
=Explanation=
        In the EARLY frames of animation of YOUR character being thrown,
        just tap a button, usually strong or fierce, possibly any.
        If it makes you feel better, move the stick left or right as well.
Consequences:
        As you rebound from being thrown, you can get hit before you're
        able to defend it. One such example being Vega, who can
        throw-slide.
NOTE:
        Someone managed to air-throw Ken out of his DRAGON PUNCH while it
        was STILL GOING UP.  I've witnessed VEGA doing so, others
        used Cammy.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    PART 3: USING THE "SUPER" VERSION OF YOUR CHARACTER IN SUPER TURBO!
                   (confirmed by Rasheed Rankins)
                   (or:  how to wimp out at ssf2t)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

If you want to play the "Super" version of a character (as opposed to the
Super Turbo version), you have to select your character with JAB. Then,
while the plane is flying to the top of the screen, tap JAB repeatedly
while either moving the joystick left-to-right or up-to-down. On the
character selection screen, characters belonging to odd-numbered columns
use the left-to-right method while those belonging to even numbered
columns use the up-to-down method.

Exceptions:
	So far, there is one exception to this rule, which is Cammy. In
	order to get the SSF2 version of her, do the OPPOSITE of what would
	normally be the proper stick movement.

	select with & tap jab button and...

SHAKE STICK LEFT/RIGHT:         SHAKE STICK UP/DOWN:
-----------------------         --------------------
Ryu, Ken, Blanka, Zangief       Honda, Chun Li, Guile,
T-Hawk, Balrog, Fei Long,       Dhalsim, Cammy, Dee Jay,
& Vega                          Sagat & M. Bison


Gamest Magazine claims there's an EXACT set of stick motions
for getting the characters, although the above technique
works just fine as well.  Here's their take on this:

Picking the Super version of a character:
-----------------------------------------
 
o To pick the Super version of a character, pick the character with any
  button.  Then enter the following joystick motions and press jab.
 
          Ryu      - RRRL           T. Hawk  - RRLL
          Ken      - LLLR           Cammy    - UUDD
          E. Honda - UUUD           Dee Jay  - DDUU
          Chun Li  - DDDU           Fei Long - LLRR
          Blanka   - LRRR           Balrog   - RLLL
          Zangief  - RLLL           Vega     - LRRL
          Guile    - UDDD           Sagat    - UDDU
          Dhalsim  - DUUU           M. Bison - DUUD
 
 
NOTE:
      Choosing the SSF2 version of your character WILL NOT give you an
      exact replication of the SSF2 character.
        EXAMPLES:
          * Balrog: standing rushing punches, while they do hit low, are
            more vunerable to kicks that they used to be, and
            noticably shorter.
          * Sagat: roundhouse is still shorter than it used to be.
        So in other words, attempting to use the SSF2 version will _most
        likely_ give you a hybrid variation on your character (there may be
        exceptions) 

- If two players both pick the same character in SSF2 mode, (i.e. ken vs.
  ken) both characters will wear VERY similar, almost identical uniforms
  with just a very slight shade of colour difference between them. 

= There are two BIG weaknesses that come with choosing
  the SSF2 mode of characters.
  * The SSF2 versions CANNOT USE SUPER COMBOS.
  * The SSF2 versions CANNOT SOFTEN THROWS.

              PART 4: THE WORLD WARRIORS: INDIVIDUAL DETAILS
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
-----------
** AKUMA **
-----------
 * Super Combo:  None
 * Fireball
   | \ -O + punch
   O  O
 * Red Multi-hit fireball
   O- / | \ -O + punch.  Jab hits once, strong hits twice,
     O  O  O             fierce hits 3 times.
 * Hurricane Kick
   |  /  O- + kick.  Slightly invulnerable at start, hits on the
   O O               way up (like ken's), slow as Ryu's, taps into VE.
 * Uppercut
   -O | \ -O + punch.  All his uppercuts can hit up to 3 times.
      O  O             Taps into the VE as well.
 * Air fireball
   (jump) + | \ -O + punch.  Shoots an aerial fireball, but CPU
            O  O             Akuma shoots two at a time.  How? Dunno.
 * Gliding Teleport
   -O | \ -O + ALL punch or kick or O- |  / O- + ALL punch or kick
      O  O                             O O
   Using kicks makes you travel about a half-screen.  Using punches
   makes you travel a full screen across.
---------
** RYU **
---------
 * Super Combo: "Vacuum Fireball" "Shinkuu Hadouken"
     | \  --O | \  --O     + any punch
     O  O     O  O
   A fireball that hits up to FIVE times, even if target is airborne
 * Rushing Punch (1): 
        --O     + STRONG (stand to block)
 * Rushing Punch (2):
        --O     + FIERCE (block in any position)
 * 2-Hit Air Punch:
        <jump forward/back> + STRONG
   This punch initiates the "Volleyball Effect" if it connects (section 7).
 * Fireball disappears after travelling roughly 3/4 of the playing
   field (not the screen area, the ENTIRE field)
 * Shorter ROUNDHOUSE and FORWARD sweeps.
 * Hurricane Kick seems improved, and "lands better" with Ryu more able to
   retaliate after landing. 
 * NOTE: Ryu's Dragon Punches are no longer invincible.
 = VERSION ADVANTAGES:
        SSF2T:  Better Hurricane Kick
                New rushing punches a fair asset to have.  
        SSF2:   Totally invulnerable uppercut
                Longer ROUNDHOUSE and FORWARD sweeps?
                Performs Fireball trapping better?
---------
** KEN **
---------
 * Super Combo: "Violent Dragon Punch" "Double Dragon" "Shyoryureppa"
        --O | \  --O | \       + any punch
            O  O     O  O
   JAB dragon punch followed by a FIERCE dragon punch
 * New Roundhouse Kick 1:
	| \  --O      + tap any kick
	O  O      
    animation resembles his old roundhouse (far).
 * New Roundhouse Kick 2:
	--O \  |      + tap any kick
	     O O
    swings foot across at chest level, can be used in combos.
 * New Roundhouse Kick 3:
         O-- / | \ --O  + tap any kick
            O  O  O
   These are new and better animated versions of the old regular roundhouse.
   They will knock an aerial opponent to the far side of the screen and
   can be used to end a combo.
 * New Axe Kick 1:
	| \  --O	+ hold down kick button
	O  O        
 * New Axe Kick 2:
	--O \  |	+ hold down kick button
	     O O
 * New Axe Kick 3:
        O-- / | \ --O   + hold down kick button
           O  O  O
   Theses will do Axe Kicks (new animation) that you must STAND up to
   block.  There IS a difference between NAK 1 and NAK 2, but
   we're not really sure how one is better than the other.
   It's speculated NAK 2 is better in combos and generally faster.
   Also, NAK 2 swings higher faster.  Don't know enough about how
   NAK #3 is dramatically different or such, but then again the
   diference between NAK 1 & 2 aren't extremely great either.
 * Air Throw:

	Ken will grab his opponent and hit'em with his knee repeatedly.
        Tap button & shake stick to increase bash speed.
 * Fireball now disappears after travelling 3/4 across the playing
   field (not the screen area, but the ENTIRE field)
 * His air ROUNDHOUSE no longer can do neck kicks H
 * His ground standing ROUNDHOUSE is a spin kick to the knee area which 
   also moves him forward.  It has great range & good damage.
 * His close range standing forward has been altered.  It is no longer
   a knee, but instead a very brief one-hit axe kick.
 * The Hurricane Kick seems to "land better".  He's more able to throw
   after landing.
 * Shorter ROUNDHOUSE and FORWARD Sweep.
 * New jumping FORWARD, better range and priority.
 * Uppercut damage has been boosted, as well as his TOD combo.
 * NOTE: Ken's Dragon Punch is NO longer invulnerable
=VERSION ADVANTAGES:
        SSF2T:  New attacks a fair asset to close-up fighting
                New FORWARD and ROUNDHOUSE may have good properties
                Jab Uppercut does more damage
                HK not as vunerable when it lands
        SSF2:   Invulnerable uppercut
                Neck kick ability in ROUNDHOUSE kick (can't do that in SSF2T)
                Some may prefer his original regular kicks.
                Probbably performs Fireball trapping better.

** E. Honda **
--------------
 * Super Combo: "Super Killer Head Ram" "Double Torpedo"
         O-- <charge> --O  O-- --O       + any punch
   Does 2 Torpedos that hit multiple times
   You can do the motions for it, but instead of immediately tapping punch
       just keep the stick in a forward direction (jumping forward, 
       walking forward, crouching forward, whatever).  When you tap a
       punch button, the Super Combo will automatically begin.
       You loose the charge if you reverse the direction of your
       stick or tap a kick button.
 * Uchio Throw (or "Mega-Buttafuco Slam")
	|  / O--        + FIERCE
	O O
   Honda will grab your opponent, smash 'em head-first into the floor,
   leaps up, and then SITS ON 'EM! It has as much range as T-hawk's Dunk.
   The damage level is roughly 30%.
 * Regular move alterations:
        Now in SSF2T            Was in SSF2
        ------------            -----------
        standing SHORT          crouching SHORT
        crouching SHORT         [close] SHORT

        standing FIERCE         crouching FIERCE
        [close] FIERCE          standing FIERCE
 * Fierce punch (grab at feet) no longer knocks down opponent.
 * Jumping straight up fierce can be moved forward by stick movement.
 * Priority of jumping fierce may be boosted.
 * his close standing strong punch now can hit earlier in it's animation.
 * HHS (Hundred Hand Slap) no longer controlled as before.  The action
    of the HHS depends on which button you choose to mash:
  * FIERCE:
        flies forward VERY fast about half the screen, then doesn't move
        forward any more. If you keep tapping the button, he'll still do
        the HHS, he just won't budge any further in any direction.
  * STRONG:
        glides along forward at a fair pace, a little faster than his
        walking speed, and then stops just as the FIERCE HHS does.
  * JAB:
        starts up the HHS, but he won't budge at all.
=VERSION ADVANTAGES:
        SSF2T:  foot grab quicker to do
                Buttafuco attack seems to have better range
                he's got that mega-buttafuco throw
                really fast forward moving HHS.
                that bit about controlling the jumping straight up fierce.
        SSF2:   overhead FIERCE chop comes out more than in SSF2T version
                precise control of HHS movement.

** BLANKA **
------------
 * Super Combo: "Grand Shave Roll"
         O-- <charge> --O  O-- --O     + any punch
   Rolls into ball, bounces up for a moment, and then
   rolls along ground for multiple hits. Can dive under "narrow" fireballs.
   (i.e. Sonic Boom, Air Slasher, High Tiger Shot, Yoga Fire, etc...)
   The ball can hit even as it's bounding upwards.
   Hold the punch button down to spin in place for a while.
 * Hop:
         O-- <or> --O       + all 3 kick
   The Hop is somewhat immune to any regular attack: you cannot punch/kick
   Blanka as he is moving forward. However, Blanka CAN get hit by a special
   move, particulary anything of a torpedo/projectile nature. Also, he has
   a _brief_ moment of vulnerability where he can get hit or thrown as he
   stops the hop, but it's very short.
   In earlier beta versions it could go through fireballs.
 * Sliding Punch:
        \             + FIERCE
         O
   This sliding punch can dive under only "narrow" fireballs (as explained
   above with the SuperCombo) _and_ Bison's torpedo.
 * Arch ball is faster, but who needs it?
 * Vertical ball now drops Blanka straight down instead of retreating.
 * His jumping ROUNDHOUSE, and all his FIERCE punches, have been greatly
   improved in range and speed. 
 * Somewhat better recovery after BlankaBall, as he's able to jump over
   any retaliatory fireball from Ken, has a fair shot at blocking or dodging
   Sagat's, but still can't dodge Ryu's.
=VERSION ADVANTAGES:
        Honestly, do you really have to ask? SSF2T is THE Blanka
        to use. There are NO advantages to using the SSF2 version.

** GUILE **

 * Super Combo: "Double Summersault Kick" "Double Flash..." "Double Slash..."
         / <charge> \   / <to> O        + any kick
        O            O O       |
   SHORT flash kick followed by a ROUNDHOUSE flash kick
  * New forward kick:
        O-- <or> --O         + FORWARD
    Guile will do his "Chuck Norris/Van Damme" type spin kick and move
    forward or backwards (dependant upon stick direction). Nice for SB type
    trap or surprise.  May also be able to hop above low tiger shots.
  * Old knee hop:
        O-- <or> --O                    + SHORT
  * Old backfist:
        --O                             + FIERCE
  * New roundhouse: If the opponent is far, it will do a skip-forward
        + kick to the shin.  If the opponent is very near, Guile will
        do a stationary kick that aims for the head.
  * New fierce: a straight forward punch, Ken/Ryu-type punch range.
  * Size of Flash Kick proportional to strength of kick, SHORT FK being a
    bit smaller than a FORWARD FK.
=VERSION ADVANTAGES
        SSF2T:  Handy-dandy new FORWARD & ROUNDHOUSE
                Flash Kick may be longer.
        SSF2:   Some may prefer his original FIERCE and ROUNDHOUSE

** CHUN LI **
-------------
* Super Combo: "Thousand Burst Kick" "Lightning Strike"
        O-- <charge> --O  O-- --O       + any kick
    Does a charging SHORT kick followed by a Lightning Kick barrage
    Chun can do the same trick with her SC that Honda has (in other
    words, for more info See Honda)
 * Spinning Bird Kick:
	O-- <charge> --O                + any kick
    NOTE:  the SBK no longer hits on it's way up.
           Essentially, it is kinda useless.
 * Jumping Lightning Kick:	
	| <charge> O                    + any kick
	O          |
   Hits 3 times in air, It is very vertical, having 
   roughly the same range as Ryu's Uppercut.
   Not very impressive damage, but looks okay.
   taps into the "Volleyball Effect" but tough to do.
 * Parabolic Spinning Bird Kick is possible, but I'm not 100% sure
   of it's execution.  It's probably
		       O
        O-- <charge>  /    + kick
 * Neck Flip:
        \      + ROUNDHOUSE
         O
                can be done even if opponent is far away.  Handy in some
                scenarios where you want to dodge fireballs.
 * Back Flip:
        \      + FORWARD
         O
               can be done even if opponent is far away.
 * Her fireball charge seems to be shorter.
 * Her forward kick is better in combos now.
=VERSION ADVANTAGES:
        SSF2T:  Seemingly quicker fireball chargeup
                New air kick
                Better modified forward kick
        SSF2:   The only reason you'd want to use her is because you feel
                the new stuff is unnecessary or irritating. 
                Superior SBK.

** Zangief **
-------------
 * Super Combo: "Final Atomic Buster"
       720 degree motion     + any punch
    Does a German Double Suplex followed by a SPD has done up to 70% damage! 
    The Super Meter will NOT lose it's charge until you actually succeed in
    grabbing your target.
 * Green Hand or "Banishing Hand" "Vanishing Flat"
        --O \  |      + FIERCE
             O O
   Can follow with a SPD
 * Hopping Gut Crunch
       O-- <or> --O       + STRONG or FIERCE
   Don't use this too much. It HAS managed to stop a BlankaBall in mid-flight.
   Can *barely* go over some sweeps.
 * SPD may have more range.
 * Lariat punch seems to be improved, lower starting strike zone, can take
   out a Honda torpedo better. 
 * NOTE: He no longer has the "magic throw" bug, not in ANY version.
= VERSION ADVANTAGES
        SSF2T:  "green hand" a fair anti-fireball tool
                but an excellent way to "tick"
                Lariat punch improved
        SSF2:   The jabs can handle Honda's torpedo better
                Lacks the "gimp" move of SSF2T that can, if not managed
                carefully, can get Zangief killed

   Super-charged Yoga Flame that hits multiple times.

    O--  / | \  --O     + any kick
        O  O  O
     Dhalsim spews a flame cloud into the air.
 * Joystick must now be in neutral or forward to get extended limb attacks.
 * If you hold back, you'll get "short" attacks, those attacks that used to
   automatically come out when your opponent was near. Keeping the stick in
   neutral or offensive positioning will allow Dhalsim's limbs to extend to
   it's maximum lengths. 
 * The torpedo is nearly horizontal.
 * The drills are of varying angles, based upon the kick button used.
   * ROUNDHOUSE: near vertical angle
   * FORWARD: 45 degree angle
   * SHORT: near horizontal angle
 * His crouching goofy SHORT kick from classic SF2 is back
 * A New very straight jumping STRONG punch
 * A New jumping JAB punch
 * His teleport has new animation and seems to be less vunerable.
=VERSION ADVANTAGES
        SSF2T:  Anti-air flame
                More angle-controlled drills
                Better air strong punch
                Teleport is fast any very much less vunerable
        SSF2:   Limbs will naturally extend to appropriate length

 * Super Combo: "Spin Dive Smasher"
    | \  --O | \    + any kick

   Does a Cannondrill followed by a Thrust Kick
 * Cannonball Jump:
     / | \  --O  O  + strong/fierce
    O  O  O     /
   She'll spin up in a ball, and the next part is up to you:
	(NOTE:  nobody's 100% sure about this yet)
   # If she's near target, she'll do one of two throws. To execute the
     throw, tap a kick button as you're in the ball. The opponent should be
     reasonably near.
     # she'll leg grab you
     # she'll grab, plant her feet in your face and smash you to the ground
    It's theorized that this is determined either by using kick or punch,
    or by whether or not your opponent was crouching when he gets thrown.
     # In a Japanese vidmag, it's said that the kind of throw done
    is determined by the time that you press the kick button.  According
    to them, if you push the button when she's near her opponent's head,
    she'll do the leg-grab, when she's near her opponent's mid-section
    she'll do the other throw, and if you've done it later you'll just
    do the slide.
   # If no throw is attempted, she will go into a slide which goes under
     fireballs and disrupts Honda's headbutt if Honda doesn't get it out in
     time. 
 * She can do the jump w/o doing either a slide or throw, and it is
   GUESSED that you must leave the stick in neutral to do so.
 * The JAB spinning punch is known to have a FEW frames of
   invulnerability at the very earliest frames of invulnerability, while
   the STRONG & FIERCE seem to be lacking in invulnerability.
   (creds to mike chang)
 * Her air throw, particularly her leg air throw, has a BIGGER range.
 * Shorter hangtime
 * Shorter SHORT drill, but better recovery.
=VERSION ADVANTAGES
        SSF2T:  Cannonball Jump
                Better air throw
                Lower hangtime

 * Triple Axe Jump: "Rekkuukyaky"
     / | \  --O  O       + any kick
    O  O  O     /
   Uses the frames of animation from his old jumping roundhouse to jump in
   an arch, can hit up to 3 times.  Taps into Volleyball effect for
   a maximum of 3 times.  Can be used in combos.
 * New Forward Kick:
    --O     + FORWARD
   Uses the same frames as in Super, but it moves forward and it can only be
   blocked by standing up to block. It can travel over sweeps such as Ryu's
   ROUNDHOUSE and Guile's FORWARD.
 * New ROUNDHOUSE jumpkick uses animation of his old jump straight up
   roundhouse.
 * New near neutral standing forward kick.
 * His hangtime might be longer by a little bit. 
 * Has air throw:  he uses the animation of the grab-the-head-and-sling-you
	throw.  Use STRONG or FIERCE.
=VERSION ADVANTAGES
        SSF2T:  Has new arching multi-hit Axe Kick
        SSF2:   Shorter Hangtime (not by much)
                Retains goofy but effective jumping roundhouse kick

** DEE JAY **
------------- 
 * Super Combo: "Carnival Hook Kick" "Quadruple Rolling Sabot Kick"
     O-- <charge> --O, O-- --O       + any kick
   He'll do 2 Double Dred Kicks.
 * Double Axe Jump: "Jack Knife Maximum"
    | <charge> O       + any kick
    O          |
   He does a spin kick in the air. The stronger the kick, the more spins
   you do. Looks sweet, and is fairly effective.
   NOTE: This move taps into the "Volleyball effect". If the kick does not
         hit three times, you can do another axe jump to make  the total #
         of hits three. 
 * Slide is altered.  It travels shorter but more easily travels
   cleanly under small fireballs (sonic boom, yoga fire, etc...)
 * MGU does more damage, but NO LONGER contains ANY invulnerable frames of
   animation. 
 * Hang time is improved.
 * Jumping FIERCE is now a downward angled punch, while jumping
   STRONG is an upward angled punch.
 * Jumping roundhouse animation is _very_ much faster.
 * Jumping STRONG and FIERCE animation switched from Super to Super Turbo.
=VERSION ADVANTAGES
        SSF2T:  Seemingly better hang time
                Better damage
                New air attack
                Slide cuts under some fireballs
        SSF2:   Slide is longer??
                MGU may have invulnerability

** T. HAWK ** (credits to Julien Beasley)
-------------
 * Super Combo: "Double Mexican Typhoon" "Double Dunk"
    <720 degree motion>    + any punch
   One fierce Mega-Dunk followed by a jab Mega-Dunk. He only loses the
   charge when the throw is done. Missed attempts do not empty the power
   meter.  One person has managed to do the stick motions first, then
   walk forward a bit and tap the button to do the SC.
 * All you need to do to execute a Dive is to hit all 3 punch buttons.
   No stick movement required.
 * Shorter crouching FORWARD and standing ROUNDHOUSE
 * MAYBE a reduced hangtime.
 * Relatively sped up.
=VERSION ADVANTAGES
        SSF2T:  possibly all-around just a little faster
        SSF2:   his FORWARD and ROUNDHOUSE kick is longer.

** BALROG **
------------
 * Super Combo:  "Dashing Upper Cuts" "Frenzy" "Mad Dash" "Crazy Buffalo"
        O-- <charge> --O, O-- --O       + any punch or kick
   He does 5 rushing punches in a row.
 * Two New Ducking Rushing punches:
        O-- <charge> \                  + any punch or kick
                      O
   The punch will end in a ROUNDHOUSE animation and (obviously) hit low,
   but has less range than his old charging punches. I don't know why they
   bothered with the kick, as it's justa lower version of the charging kick
   and still doesn't hit low.
 * Balrog, while jumping straight up, can move forward by
    using the FIERCE button and the stick.
 * Balrog seems to do more damage per hit.
 * Balrog's standing FIERCE punch is shorter BUT faster.
 * Balrog's Buffalo Headbutt goes longer and hits lower.
=VERSION ADVANTAGES
        SSF2T:  low dashing punch which is an asset in some situations
                (especially against Zangief)
        SSF2:   standing rushing punches hit low
                (but _are_ shorter ranged than in previous versions)

** VEGA **
----------
 * Super Combo: "Rolling Izuna Backdrop"
         /  <charge> \   / <to> O   O           + any kick
        O             O O        \ /
    This executes a normal wall dive.  However, if you connect with the
    bodyslam, you will get 3 bodyslams instead of one. The SUPER METER
    _ONLY_ goes down when you get the 3 bodyslams off. You will NOT see Vega
    leaving a trail of shadows UNTIL you actually grab your target,
    otherwise, it looks like a normal dive and you can make opponents
    nervous like this. 
 * Forward Flip:
         / <charge> --O        + any kick
        O
   Barely goes through fireballs, can hit aerial target twice. Once you have 
   this move charged, you may stand up but you MUST stay in a defensive stance 
   (i.e. hold your stick away from opponent).  Taps into volleyball effect.
   * NOTE:  you may stand up after your Forward Flip is charged.  Just
          keep your stick in a defensive position.
 * If your claw falls off, you can pick it up again by just walking over it.
 * You must stand up to block Vega's off-the-wall slash (missed
   air-backbreaker/izuna drop).  
 * The range of his crouching STRONG and JAB have been shortened a little.
=VERSION ADVANTAGES
        SSF2T:  very effective new forward flip
                can pick up claw after it falls off
                quick chargeup time for everything.
        SSF2:   None known.

** SAGAT **

 * Super Combo:  "Tiger Genocide"
    --O | \  --O | \                + any punch
        O  O     O  O
   A Tiger Knee followed by a Tiger Uppercut.
 * Fireball recovery is almost as bad as his HF delay
 * TU damage is now reduced to unimpressive, very Ken/Ryu-type levels, even
   though it hits for a maximum of 5 times.  Sometimes it won't even
   hit that much.
 * Roundhouse has less rage, jumping and crouching.
 * All of his kicks are now interruptable and therefore usable in combos.
 * Only the JAB Tiger Uppercut is sure to knock down an opponent if struck
   on the ground. The FIERCE TU has left opponents standing on occasion.
 * Also, his kicks can be used in FULL extension for combos: in other
   words, you can allow his SHORT and FORWARD kicks to make contact TWICE
   and STILL shoot a fireball for a combo, and with this a 5 hit combo MAY
   be possible (jumping kick - standing STRING - Tiger Knee)
=VERSION ADVANTAGES
        SSF2T:  the standard SC & softening throws stuff.
        SSF2:   This is strange. BOTH versions have the ability to use BOTH
                hits of his FORWARD and SHORT kick as part of a combo, and
                BOTH have the shortened ROUNDHOUSE. BUT SSF2 mode Sagat has
                a more powerful uppercut and quicker fireball recovery.
                Makes for a better long range fight and fireball trapping.
                I have to wonder what the advantage of using SSF2T Sagat
                is, other than the standard two reasons.

** M. BISON **
--------------
 * Super Combo:  "Knee Press Nightmare"
       O-- <charge> --O O-- --O                + any kick
   Does 2 Scissor Kicks in a row <kinda like how he always did in Classic SF2>
 * "Devil's reverse":
        | <charge> <to> O  O  O  + any punch
        O                \ | /
   It is now controllable. He'll fly where you send him and fake a
   headstomp. If you press punch AGAIN, he will dive down, and you can
   control his descent. Don't press it and you'll fly off, maybe to a safe
   distance. Has less priority than in SUPER (credits to Stiltman)
 * Scissor Kick has improved "bounceback" and recovery, leaving Bison
   not-as-vunerable afterwards anymore.   Still, you can't get
   reckless with it.
 * Scissor kicks lash out faster than before.
 * Scissor Kick charge time just a little longer than before.
 * Damage levels are _fairly_ high, and torpedo seems to take off a little
   bit more when blocked than his SSF2 version.
 * Also may retain high stun ability.
 * Jumping STRONG punch is altered:
   It is a two-hitter punch. The first uses the graphics of his SSF2 straight
   up jumping jab now for jumping forward & back.  To get the second
   hit, you must tap the button again, and he'll execute another punch which
   uses the animation of his jumping straight up fierce punch.
   So graphically, it will look like a left-right punch combination.
=VERSION ADVANTAGES
        SSF2T:  Torpedo takes off more damage if blocked
                Scissor kick is faster in it's execution and it's
                recovery (you are less likely to be thrown after
                your scissor kick is blocked)
                Also his regular hits are more damaging.
                Oh yeah, that cool volleyball stuff :)

                         PART 5: HIDDEN CHARACTER
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Name:  ???
  His energy bar has NO name, so nobody is 100% sure. There are two
  version of what his REAL name should be.
   * Goki Long: ("son of Sheng Long") assigned by several
     magazines & assumed by everyone since that stupid EGM april fools
     stunt.
   * Goki (spelling?) (no Long) his name in japanese versions?
   * Sheng Long:  again, a byproduct of kids and that April EGM.
   * Akuma: (japanese for "devil") the name he's known by in
     Japan.  EGM also calls him Akuma.  Also... according to Ming
     (you're not kidding, right?) "Akuma" was the name on some
     promotional posters and such that Capcom gave out.

 * -=His Story=-
  
   And so vctrl113062@aol.com writes....
 
    "[from the EGM book] there are two pages devoted to Akuma. The
  book gives some of his stats and says, among other things, that 
  he is named Gouki in Japan, and that according to "Japanese 
  sources" he is the brother of Ken and Ryu's Master (Sheng Long in 
  the US, Gouken in Japan). It says that Akuma/Gouki & Sheng 
  Long/Gouken both learned the fireball/hurricane kick/dragon punch 
  from a Master Goutetsu, and that these three techniques were 
  initially meant for killing. Sheng Long/Gouken removed the "intent 
  to kill" from these moves when he taught them to Ken & Ryu. 
  Akuma/Gouki has no such reservations, and Master Goutetsu's 
  "mysterious death" was supposedly at his hands. And now, it 
  seems as though Akuma/Gouki wanders the world looking for 
  worthy opponents to fight to the death..."

 * Description:
  Imagine Ryu's body with a ponytailed head on it, the hair looking a
  bit fiery.  His clothes are all black, his pants are ragged at the
  ends.  He is darkly tanned and his face says "I'm pissed".
  He's also sporting sandals and a necklace of some sort.
  His fireballs are shot with a grunt, "hrgh!", and his uppercuts
  sound similar to this as well.  He does _not_ use any words.
  He has two victory poses.  One of them is Akuma shaking his
  fists much like Fei Long does.  The other is him turning his back
  away while a red symbol fades into his back (it resembles an
  "E" and might mean "heaven" or something like that)

 * The Grand Entrance:  Your plane will fly off to Bison's place.
  You and Bison will be standing there, but there won't be a
  "ROUND 1:  FIGHT!" voice.  You'll _know_ you got Akuma if
  the picture box where Bison's portrait should be is left black.
  From _behind_ you, Akuma will warp in, stopping in front of
  Bison.  The screen will fade to white, you'll hear the sounds
  of hits being landed and see the little star marks which indicate
  that someone was hit, and then the screen will fade from total
  white to normal, revealing Akuma standing over the beaten
  body of M. Bison.  It's kinda weird if you are using
  Bison at the moment.  Oh yeah, Bison's body stays on the scene
  for all the rounds you fight Akuma

:::How to Reach Him:::
  I have NO idea. People have reached him in various ways:
   * even though they have lost rounds
   * even though they have continued
   * even though they have previously engaged in two player mode
     (I myself have gotten to Akuma after many people played
     the machine and switched characters, colors, and sides,
     lost many rounds, & continued a ridiculous amount of times)
   * A theory from Gamest Magazine claims that you must beat
     The first three bosses w/o loosing a round or continuing.
:::The Most Sure-Fire Way to Get to Akuma:::
  * Use SC's every chance you get, don't loose rounds, don't continue
    don't win by timeout.  This may not be the exact requirement,
    but if you go by this stuff, you've covered just about any guess
    as to how to get to Akuma.
  *but even if you do all this, there's no guarantees.
:::Theories (NOT proven):::
  * One theory suggests it is related to your points scored.
  * One more theory links the performing of SC's to getting to Akuma.
  * Final theory: It's all just RANDOM

:::Statistics (how badass is he?):::

  (big assist by caine schneider <caines@ncsa.uiuc.edu>)

Having seen him a few times, here are some things to expect: 

 * triple hit red fireball. like ryu's SC.  You'll know when he shoots
   it because you can see him tense up before shooting it.  However,
   his fireball is released _faster_ than _any_  character.  It also
   engulfs you in flames if it hits.  He is disabled by the fireball
   long enough for most characters to get a hit in (except probably
   Zangief, T-Hawk, & Honda).  The damage done by this is heavy, about
   30% or more.  He will often attempt to catch you off guard by
   doing a forward sweep - red fireball combo.  If you don't
   block the sweep, you probably won't block the fireballs.
 * double air fireball, aimed down about 45 degrees. this is actually two
   fireballs side by side.  The graphics for this are new.  You
   can see the image of Akuma's left & right hands in the two fireballs.
   The primary hazard of this attack is that it pins you down and
   is hard to get past/jump over.  The damage done by it is not 
   overwhelming, about the strength of a strong/fierce punch.
 * two or three hit hurricane kick.  It does tremendous damage and leaves
   you knocked down after it's done.  Akuma will often use this in his
   jumps at you.  He can also follow the hurricane kick with an uppercut
   (this is a massive combo)
 * two/three-hit dragon punch, which acts like a super combo move, 
   meaning he can hit you while you are in the air, AND that the
   damage is massive.
 * regular fireball that resembles Ryu's but is shot out _much_ faster. 
 * screen dash that has invulnerability. he switches sides very rapidly
   with black (not blue) shadows trailing him. He is vulnerable after he
   emerges from it for a brief while.
 * ticks. he will tick you. standing short kick followed by leg throw seems
   to be one of his favorites.
 * this fight is all ranges. you have to fight him from mid-range to win.
   too close is bad since he is so fast, too far and he will pummel you
   with all of his fireballs. the ground fireballs are really fast! he
   likes to jump. 
 * he is not big at all. just imagine ryu's black outfit, and a gnarly
   looking head with red hair. 
 * he is fast. faster than ken or ryu, but not like vega or chun li. more
   like fei long.
 * he performed this combo: two-hit air hurricane, jab dp. the DP hit before
   the guy landed like a super combo.

Attack Patterns and habits:
 There are several offensive sets that Akuma will employ.
  * Often, he will jump up, do the air fireball, land before
     you're through blocking them, and launch a red fireball.
  *  He'll jump away shooting air fireballs and back them up
     with a red fireball as soon as he lands.
  * He will jump at you with a helicopter kick, and if it hits,
     he'll follow through with a DP.
  * At least half the time he'll soften a throw if you try to
     toss him.
  * He will mostly not DP the Blankaball and just block it.
     In the second round, the odds of him DPing it increase.
  * He will mostly DP any other attack that approaches him,
     including any badly timed jumps, Bison attacks, Vega
     punches/kicks, Dhalsim limbs, etc etc etc.  
  * Every now and then he will just jump at you with
     a normal roundhouse kick.  You must take advantave
     of when he does this.
  * Going offensive at him mostly won't work.  Reacting to
     his mistakes (warping at you, jumping at you, shooting
     a fireball when you can see it coming a mile away, etc...)
     is your best bet.

Known weaknesses:
   * Will jump towards you. Easy target for any anti-air attacks.
      he won't do this often, so take advantage if it when it happens.
   * Will not block or retaliate after Vega's wall spike.  He WILL once
      in a while, but not often.
   * Will _mostly_ just block blankaballs.  Once in a while he may
      dragon punch it, but mostly not.
   * His multi-hit flaming fireball has a longer delay before launch and
      after.  Watch for when he tenses up and seems on fire, and attack.

5.1) ============How to USE Akuma/Gouki==================
      That's right.  You can play AS the hidden character.
      Here's the safest method known so far:
      - put your square on ryu.  Say in your head
        "thousand-1, thousand-2, thousand-3"
        Don't be afraid to say it a bit fast.
      - go to T-Hawk's square.  Again, do the 3-count.
      - go to Guile's square.  Again, do the 3-count.
      - go to Cammy's square.  Again, do the 3-count.
      - go to Ryu/Ken's square.  Again, do the 3-count.
      - Hit ALL punch buttons and the start button AT THE SAME TIME.
        If you misfire, keep on mashing those buttons.  The computer
        gives you a half second to get it right.

      *note: the pause on each character can be as short as
             1 1/2 seconds.  Just make sure that you keep the
             delay consistent for every character.  If you start
             with a 3 second delay, stay with it for all squares.
      *note2: AFTER you have finished moving to all the squares
              and BEFORE you press all the buttons, there is one
              precaution you may want to try.  Move your square
              to a character you want to play in case the
              code does not work, and THEN press the buttons.
              REMEMBER, do this AFTER you're done moving through
              all the squares and BEFORE you hit the buttons.

 ===DIFFERENCES BETWEEN CPU GOUKI/AKUMA & HUMAN GOUKI/AKUMA===
       Anyone who's played against Akuma/Goki would think that being
       allowed to use A/G would be unfair.  Not so.  The playable
       version of Akuma/Goki is toned down in two ways:
       - more delay after fireballs, ESPECIALLY the red fireballs.
       - fireballs do less damage.
       This makes A/G much easier to fight against than the CPU
       A/G.  Still, he's a tough bastard.  He has all the standard
       moves of the classic ken/ryu, his uppercut has ryu-like
       (or more) damage & range, but hits multiple times a la Ken
       and is invulnerabe, or at least has the highest possible
       priority, as it does beat Ken & Ryu's DP, Sagat's TU, and
       just about anything else that is of a DP/FK nature.
       His HK hits on the way up & can hit multiple times
       like Ken's but is slightly invulnerable at the start 
       like Ryu's HK.  His red fireball delay is as bad/worse than
       Ken's fireball delay, his normal fireball travels fast
       and it's delay is near/equal to Ryu's.  Not faster, I think.
       Basically, he's a Ryu/Ken blend with more tricks and better speed.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
                         PART 6: MISC. DETAILS
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Most Improved Characters:       Blanka
                                Dee Jay

Least Improved Characters:      T-Hawk
                                Sagat

Speed:
  For the first couple of days that you play it, the speed will
  overwhelm you, but after about 3 days, you'll be comfortable with
  it again, and even maximum speed is easy.  Just before you
  play the CPU you'll be given a choice of speeds 1 through
  3.  In one-on-one situations, the winner of the last game
  will choose speed.  Speed 3 is ideal for the "fast" characters
  such as Vega, Chun, and Blanka.  Also, it certainly can't
  hurt to boost up the speed if you are a tickfest-type player.

Introduction:
  Just as in SSF2, there will be Ryu, pacing himself and getting
  a fireball ready.  The screen will flash to Cammy's scene,
  a slightly different perspective, and Chun Li will appear with
  her back turned away (they drew her neck & chin too think,
  imho).  Then it will flash back to Ryu, further into his fireball
  shot, flash back to Cammy's place again, with Cammy now coming into
  view, sticking her tongue out.  Ryu's reeealy tensing up now
  when the hidden boss is shown in profile black & white, his
  back turned to you.  It quickly flashes between him and
  Ryu until Ryu finally lets his fireball go.

Selection screen:
  Two rows of characters, much less crowded than the SSF2 selection
  screen, with a redrawn map.  The original characters occupy
  the left 8 boxes, the 4 bosses occupy the far right boxes,
  and the characters introduced from SSF2 are in the center area.
  When you and an opponent are about to go at it, 
  the portraits of the opposing characters are shown, 
  with a blue frame and a moving background
  (very nice, imho).

Overall:
  The characters seem to have been modified for better close-range
  fighting (and for some, at the cost of their long range strategy).
  Some examples would be the improvement of Bison's Scissor Kick,
  Sagat's ability to tack on a fireball if his opponent blocks (or
  doesn't) a SHORT/FORWARD kick, Ryu's new rushing punch, and the
  alteration of Vega since Super. Even Dhalsim's alterations may have
  been an attempt to improve his close-range abilities, and his new
  Teleport certainly has more offensive possibilities. The emphasis
  on this one, definitely close range fighting. 


---------------------------------------------------------------------------
                   Part 7: The Volleyball Effect (VE)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

The Volleyball effect is a new feature in SSF2T that is somewhat akin to
the attack mode of MK. If you have an opponent in the air, and you've
already hit them, you can hit them again in their "reeling back" frames of
animation.

It's _guessed_ that the "Volleyball Effect" (VE) was a byproduct of the
installation of SuperCombos, as SuperCombos naturally have the VE, while
the normal moves may have acquired them by accident.  HOWEVER,
it doesn't really matter if they were originally accidental because
Capcom has officially promoted it as a new feature and NOT a bug that 
slipped by them (like Zangief's SSF2 magic throw).

The primary requirement SEEMS to be that your character must have a
multi-air hit capability. When struck by such an attack, the CPU places the
one who was hit into an alternate stun mode where they are reeling back but
still hittable, so that the multi-hit air attack can hit multiple times.

(note:  non-throw super combos also place targets into alternate-stun
        mode, so you can combine v-ball attacks with supercombos)

* All known non-SuperCombo VE attacks are multi-hitting attacks, 
  and are using attacks that are unique to SSF2T.

ALL SuperCombo's by their very nature retain the "Volleyball Effect" and
  are capable of hitting opponents in the air for more than
  three hits in a row.
	
As for _Regular_ moves:
  The maximum number of hits you can get from exploiting the volleyball
  effect is 3 so far. It is confirmed that Ryu, Bison, Fei Long, Vega,
  and Dee Jay _cannot_ use the VE for more than 3 hits. 
  
  * Akuma:  His VE moves are the most damaging of the non-SC volleyball
       attacks.  As usual, the limit is 3 hits.  His hurricane kick
       and uppercut tap into the VE, for a nice potential of combos.
       In the corner, two jab uppercuts in a row will work, or
       a HK & uppercut, or vice versa, etc etc etc.  Fairly easy
       to take advantage of Akuma's VE talent.  Try to work in
       the HK with combos.

  * Ryu: is proven to be able to manipulate the volleyball effect.
       He's the first one to be noticed for this trait.  His 
       v-ball attack is very much similar to Bison's.

  * Dee Jay: His Axe Jump is able to first use the Air Spin Kick on 
       an opponent, and then use another Axe Jump before 
       they land.  Very easy to do.

  * Fei Long:  His axe jump can be repeated on an opponent
       before they land for a maximum of 3 times.
       Extremely difficult to pull off.

  * Vega:  His roundhouse forward flip hits twice. Immediately
       follow with _another_ roundhouse forward flip and
       you'll get the total 3 hit limit.  Very tough 
       to pull off.

  * Bison: His jumping strong punch taps into the "Volleyball effect" 
       as well.  By repeated hitting the STRONG after the first 
       hit, Bison will then hit the opponent with his OTHER hand. 
       This will knock the opponent high enough in the air so that 
       Bison can land and jump one more time for the final jumping
       STRONG punch.  BUT you don't have to use the one-two
       punch, but instead just go one punch at a time to maximize
       time and push your opponent back.  Bison's volleyball 
       attack is very easy to use.  You can even tack it unto
       the end of his SC for a total of 7 hits.

  * Chun Li:  Her jumping triple kick, while it is much like
       Dee Jay's, cannot v-ball like Dee Jay.  Instead, her best
       shot at using it in a v-ball situation is to use the
       triple kick AFTER her Super Combo connects and her opponent
       is reeling.

  * Sagat:  it's been reported that it's possible to get a bounce
       from his fierce uppercut, either after a Super Combo or
       if you've nailed your opponent when the both of you are
       packed in the corner.  Probbably ridiculously hard to manipulate.

*  it's likely that there are MORE moves which tap into the VE yet 
    to be discovered.  

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
                  PART 8: NEW ENDINGS (SO FAR)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

In addition to the endings, one frame pictures have been added to the
endings. In general, these new pics are (imho) very well done. 

Akuma:  After he wins, the screen narrows, just as Guile's &
        Cammy's does.  Then he does one of his winning poses.
        The credits roll by while each character is shown in his
        or her _loosing_ pose.

Bison:  He sits on an Athena-in-the-Panthenon type throne holding a
    suspended globe (earth?) in his right hand, his face wearing an
    evil smile.  

Chun:   She's trying out a new dress before a mirror in some kind of store,
    while her friend stands in the back, holding Chun's spiked bracers
    (they seem to be very heavy) and her hair is down.

Dhalsim: Standing over a cliff by a raging river. A boy is in the
     river and is about to be hit by a falling log. Dhalsim saves the
     boy in one hand and pushes the log away with the other hand.

Balrog: Busy breaking a sandbag with a straight punch, while several
    sandbag sits broken in the background and other boxers cling to
    their sandbags in fright. 

Ryu:    Engaged in another street fight, blocking a straight punch from a
    punk (might be Birdie, a character of SF1 fame), some people in the
    background. 

Guile:  Down on one knee before Charlie's grave, wearing a
    solemn expression on his face and holding his friend's dog tag.

Ken:    He's in a department store, there's an escalator in the back. 
    Ken and Elisa are rushing off in a hurry with Eliza ahead and
    Pulling Ken by the hand.  Elisa is in a blue dress cut on the side, 
    Ken is in a suit (white?). He's carrying lots of boxes which are 
    about to topple over him. (See? marriage made him a wuss already.)

Zangief: He's flexing his muscles and leaning on a broken mirror, looks
    like he's in a locker room or gym of some sort. A picture of Vega
    that's been defaced by some pink colored ink is taped to the mirror.

Blanka: He's standing in a busy street, the people seem frightened or
    horrified by him. He's holding a mask of some sort and blocking
    traffic.

E. Honda: He's rampaging in his (dojo? school?), the ground trembling, the
    walls kinda shaking, his students running for cover. 

Cammy:  She's on a sidewalk by a London street full of cars, wearing a
    school uniform.  She's kneeling down and extending a hand to a
    kitten. 

Dee Jay:  Wearing headphones, a keyboard on his lap, lying out on
    a hammockon the beach and (as usual) wearing that smile.

Fei Long: He's sitting in a movie star's chair, a blond lady wiping the
    sweat from his brow.  

T-Hawk: Background desert, a few ruins too. He's facing you with his head
    turned away over his shoulder where a hawk is approaching. 

Vega:   He's in his mansion, decor being nice (tribal weapons, furs, etc),
    He's standing sideways away from you, wearing a baggy blue outfit,
    one hand in pocket, the other enjoying a nice drink. He's peering
    over his shoulder looking at you. 

Sagat:  Doing one-fingered pushups at his place (say, have any of you ever
    watched the Emmys when Billy Crystal first hosted them, and Jack
    Palance put in an appearance?)
