SS2 SECRET SHADOW MOVE FAQ v.1.7 (so I lied)
 
	Basically, this is just a collection of rumors and hearsay that 
may or may not be true at this point, including all the info on the known 
shadow moves. Put together because it interests me for some reason. Whee.

	Because people have been bugging me for it, it is now at 
ftp.netcom.com /pub/vi/vidgames/faqs.

WHAT'S NEW NOW?
 
	This new version (1.7) just has some updated info from my own 
experiences and some new stuff posted on rec.games.video.arcade about 
newly discovered moves. Plus a possible move fro Ukyo. And I alphabetized 
things. Enough to justify another addition. So I said the last one was 
it. Sue me. It's archived now, too.
 
WHAT ARE YOU TRYING TO DO HERE?
 
	Well, I'm making an offshoot to the Tapfaq at the moment. There 
have been a lot of rumors and the such about the Secret Shadow Moves and 
stuff like that, so I decided to start this thing as a clearing house for 
information about these things. When all of them are found, and while 
info for it comes in, I want to turn it all back to the Tapfaq where it 
belongs. Until then, don't sell this, but distribute it anywhere you like 
for free.
 
WHAT IS A SECRET SHADOW MOVE?
 
	Apparently, in SS2, there are undocumented (i.e. not listed on 
the game or in the manuals) attacks that can be performed that do 
incredible things and/or damage. They have only been discovered for 
certain players, but there have been enough of them to substantiate the 
idea that every character has at least one.
 
	The stories go that they can only be performed when the POW bar 
is full and they are alternates to the POW Special Moves each character 
has, and others that say they can be performed at any time. Information 
is extremely sketchy. Major consensus seems to be that these are moves 
that can be performed anytime, and the current discovered moves bear this 
out, but rumors that there are some connected to the POW bar still exist.
 
WELL, WHERE DID YOU GET THIS INFO FROM?
 
	Good question. For solid evidence, I picked out the moves that 
had already been discovered and documented in the Tapfaq v.4.0, edited by 
Shawn Holmes <shawnh@qb.island.net>. Those moves are reproduced here. I 
wanted to get the information straight on these secret shadow moves 
because they interest me, and, hey, it may save Shawn some work.
 
	As far as blind speculation, I basically picked it all out of the 
posts on rec.games.video.arcade concerning strange attacks that have been 
posted so far. In addition to unconfirmed info about the soundtrack and 
morf features, I have taken reports about moves from posts. The 'proof' 
of these attacks range from 'having seen the computer pull it off,' to 'I 
saw someone do it,' to 'I heard someone say they saw this.' Bottom line: 
if a normal faq follows the scientific method, this is old-school alchemy 
at its best. DO NOT TAKE ANYTHING HERE AT FACE VALUE.
 
HEY, I SAW THIS REALLY WEIRD MOVE, AND...
 
	Cool. Mail me about it at damone@ios.com. Everything will be 
compiled as I get it and as my health holds out. If you have anything 
that fills in any of the blanks here (or, more to the point, connects the 
vast chasms between actual facts), drop me a line. If you've heard rumors 
of a move, thought you saw a move, have the actual move itself, etc, etc, 
mail me.

WHAT'S THE ARGUMENT AGAINST THERE BEING ANY MORE SECRET SHADOW MOVES?
 
	Whelp, it goes something a little like this:
	- The Soundtrack: Every move and character in the game is 
represented on the soundtrack, even the Secret Shadow Moves listed here 
and Kuroko. If there are any more moves or characters (alla Tam Tam), 
they must not use any additional sounds, but re-use other sounds. This is 
not likely.
	- The Test Feature: Apparently there is a test morph feature for 
the game that lets the game owner test all the characters. This function 
includes Kuroko, but not Tam Tam, or any other character.
	- The 'Protagonist Attacks': Apparently someone who knows someone 
at the game company says that the Shadow Attacks that exist already are 
'Protagonist Attacks,' special attacks only for the 'heroes' of the game: 
Hoah, Nak, Galford, and Hanzo. They are the only ones to get them.
	- Weather Balloons Are Not UFOs: There are some glitches and bugs 
in the game that make it do weird things sometimes, but they are not 
special moves. As in most UFO sightings, most of the people who saw these 
things were just imagining it anyway or just saw some documented special 
attack they never saw before.
	
WHAT'S THE ARGUMENT FOR THERE BEING ANY MORE SECRET SHADOW MOVES?
 
	Whelp, it goes something like this:
	- Screw The Soundtrack And Test Feature: No matter how unlikely 
it is, there could be special moves for the other players that either 
re-use sounds already on the soundtrack, or on tracks hidden in the 
soundtrack. Ditto the Test Feature. PLUS, the secret shadow moves that 
exist already, are additions to other moves, and some do not USE 
different sounds anyway. For example, Nak's is an extension of her hawk 
strike, Hoah's is a multiple Kogetsuzan, and Hanzo and Galford's 
invisibility is an extension of their ninja teleports in that they just 
stay 'gone.' SO, the secret shadow moves for the others characters are 
extensions of other moves, and don't NEED new sounds.
	- 'Protagonist' My Ass: Nak, Hoah, Galford, and Hanzo, while 
being more involved in the 'plot' of the game than the others, are by no 
means the only 'good guys' in it. And if it is for the people in those 
story lines, why shouldn't Genjuro, Ukyo, or Nicotine have one, 
considering their connection to Haoh's storyline? And while there are 
DEFINATELY some bad guys (Gen-an, Earthquake, etc), there are definately 
other good guys (Nicotine, Cham Cham, etc), as well as those of dubious 
morality (Kyoshiro, Sieger, etc.) What about them? Why screw up game 
balance by giving super-powerful special attacks to characters who in no 
way need them? And if the good guys get attacks, why not the villains as 
well?
	- It WAS a spaceship from Venus!: Many clearly sane people, who 
have played the game for a long time, have SEEN the moves that they claim 
with their own eyes, and they did appear to be bugs (How do you mistake 
seeing Tam Tam?). Some people have even PERFORMED the moves themselves. 
And there is the enough ambiguity to allow the possibility of these moves 
being reality.
 
HOW DO I FIND SECRET SHADOW MOVES?
 
	Still convinced that more moves exist? Well, take a look at what 
we have already. It seems that all the Secret Shadow moves all have 
button combos that have both slash and kick button involved (usually BC), 
along with complex and unusual joystick movements. All of it is in some 
ways akin to the Super Deformed transformations (weird joystick 
movements/button combos). Also, all of the moves seem to have some sort 
of 'shadow' component. Haoh and Nak have 'shadows' of themselves trailing 
behind them as they perform their moves, while Hanzo and Galford turn 
INTO 'shadows.' Also, for more moves to exist at this point and defy the 
arguments against it, they are probably just extensions of moves the  
characters already have (see the examples of Charlotte and Genjuro). So 
go out, do weird things with the joystick, and hit slash and kick at the 
same time.
 
WHO DO YOU WANT TO THANK?
 
	Well, first off again, Shawn Holmes <shawnh@qb.island.net>, 
editor of the Tapfaq v.4.0, for use of some of the moves from the Tapfaq.
 
	I'd also like to thank all the posters who I borrowed from. If 
you wish to be recognized for your info, please drop me a line and you 
will be included, and accept my apologies ahead of time.
 
	If you have any info, complaints, etc, drop me a line at 
damone@ios.com. Thanks again.
