(Compiled from FIVE messages.)
--------------------------------------------------------------------

  Air Combinations:

* (all these combo's will daz any non-dazzed opponent)

* (scenario: you jump at opponent.  opponent is on ground and CLOSE
 If you're too far away, your first hit might make contact but the
 third and second hit might miss)

*(remember to time jump so opponent doesn't walk under or dragon punch
 or razor kick..etc. Usually done while opponent is getting up from
 a throw,razor kick,Blanka's roll,dragon punch,...and don't jump too
 soon or you'll miss the first hit and get thrown as you land.)

*       (FIRST HIT IS ALWAYS FROM THE AIR)

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Guile
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

AIR COMBINATIONS:

       As soon as you push the jstick in the diagnol(jumping forward)
       pull jstick back in Sonic Booming position and KEEP it there,
       for now.  Now hit the fierce punch button to hit opponent then
       then wait a 1/2 second and hit the fierce-punch-button-again-
       and-IMMEDIATELY hit the fierce punch for the third time but
       this time make it a sonic boom.

         (The reason you wait 1/2 sec between the 1st & 2nd punch is
         because if you do it too fast the 2nd punch won't register
         and most likely you'll do a sonic boom as the 2nd hit
         instead of the 3rd hit, but do it too slowly and you are
         vulnerable to a counter-throw)

        You can do another Guile combo by replacing sonic boom in the
        above procedure with a razor kick.

STRATEGIES/TRICKS:

        Guile's middle kick is a very powerful attack.
        Its reach is long and is reliable in the air.
        Use it wisely.

        Guile is one of the faster players and can walk under jumping
        players.  Guile can even throw a sonic boom and recover fast
        enough to walk under Chun Li or even Blanka!

        Usually opponents wait for Guile to throw a sonic boom so they
        can jump and attack Guile.  You can fake a sonic boom by
        pressing jab or strong punch buttons with a noticable sound. Or
        a better one is to press the fierce button while in the crouch
        position.  What happens is that Guile stands up with a fist in
        the air, but the jstick is still in the crouch position ready
        for a real sonic boom or a razor kick.

        Follow your sonic booms to "close in."  Do this against Ryu/Ken.
        With Ryu/Ken and Dhal, you are the attacker.  Against Blanka,
        Honda,Zang and Chun Li, you are the defender
        (at least initially).

        Use sonic booms a lot on Zangief.  If he jumps over them then
        roundhouse kick him.  Try avoid getting stuck in the
        corner against him.  When you can, push him back by doing some
        combinations as described above.

        Guile's jab can tag Blanka's fierce crouch punch and roundhouse
        low kick.  But the distance between players must be pretty far
        away.  Guile's jab can tag Dhal's sliding low kick.  So when
        you're right up next to him, throw some jabs in his face.  When
        close enough, Dhal cannot penetrate the jabs except with a fire
        ball.  So use jabs a lot on Dhal.  One trick is to throw jabs
        in front of his face and while Dhal thinks about what to do,
        walk up to him and throw him.  Remember, the only way to beat
        Dhal is to get close to him.

        A neat move is when Guile jumps straight up and does a short
        or forward kick.  This kick can catch Blanka's roll and even
        his crouch fierce punch.  This kick works well against Dhal's
        long legs.  It is even known to beat an attacking Blanka in
        the air.

        If Blanka attacks you by air, see if you can see a pattern
        and walk under his jumps so you can toss him.  Remember, it's
        better to block his attacks and sometimes get bitten than it is
        to take a hit and get dazed by Blanka's combo.  Guile is
        pretty good against Blanka in the air also.  Use his roundhouse
        kick because it has such a long reach.  If you notice Blanka
        fierce clawing you, then you have a good chance of throwing him
        in the air because Blanka's fierce button is usually only
        pressed at the last moment.  So you can meet him in the air,
        thus throwing off the timing of your opponent.

MORE GOODIES:

Automatic sonic boom:

        Ok the automatic sonic boom is created after Guile throws a
        opponent with strong and you keep the joystick in the thrown
        direction.  Ok throw lets say a opponent to the right and keep the
        joystick pointed right after the throw. Guile will stand up from
        the throw. As he is standing press any of the punch buttons
        repeadly. When you figure out the timing all you need to do is
        press it once , but this will aleast let you see it.  What is does
        is throw a sonic boom as he is standing or almost walking right
        without build up time. It is better to throw a jab sonic and follow
        it in.

        Also, if Zangief does any of his "throw" moves on Guile or Blanka
        then press any of the punch buttons as Guile or Blanka is standing.
        With Guile this will throw a sonic boom as he stands and Blanka it
        will do a ball.  Keep the joystick pointed at the opponent as
        Zangief "throws" you and press any of the punch buttons as you are
        standing.  No build up necessary.

Sonic kick: crouch for 3 seconds, up, hit any kick.

Sonic boom: defend crouch for 3 seconds, forward, hit any punch.

Handcuff:   Push or back opponent into corner, defend crouch, forward flp.,
            hit 2 middle buttons.

Freeze:     Jump at opponent, kick w/roundhouse (pull back to store up
            sonic boom), when you land kick with roundhouse again,
            while kick is in motion throw boom.


INFO ON CUFFS & MAGIC THROW:

        1. You can do the cuffs to anyone that is withen throwing range and
        you are built up for the razor kick. If they try short,short throw
        then build up the razor and counter them by the cuffs.

        To do the cuffs just hold the joystick in crouch, off or def or
        directly down.  When the are withen throwing range do a razor kick
        by running your fingers down strong and foward at the same time.
        DONT press each button with two fingers.  Slide your fingers down
        both buttons very fast as you lift the joystick up for a razor
        kick.

I have now found a 100% way to escape from them.  If you understand the
magic throw or Guile's touch of death then do this in cuffs and the
opponent will be thrown out. If someone "cheaps" me anymore when I play
Guile then I cuff them and wait until 6 seconds then throw them out.
Pisses them off but, he they get what is comming to them. This is only
if I have slightly less energy or more when I enter cuffs. When you
throw them out it takes away 1 throws worth of energy.

About cuffs working on any machine.  No, on version 4 SF2 the Guile bugs
DO NOT work. They have been corrected.  To test for a version 4 just try
the freeze or cuffs. If you can usually do them and you can get them to
work then it is a version 4. If you do find a version 4 then you can do
another very cool bug exclusive to version 4 machines. Anyplayer vs
anyplayer.  Ex Guile vs Guile, Dhalsim vs Dhalsim.  SOme of the any vs
any combinations like Dhalsim's lock up the machine sometimes. In one of
my previous messeges I described how to do this so scan my last messages
for the technique.

I have found a combo that gets the opponent into cuffs pretty good. DO a
jumping short, jab then cuffs. Timing is important and distance but it
works.

Anybody got the magic throw yet.  I have found the ultimate in cheap
with this. Just jump into them with just about any kick or punch.  If
they block then use jabs and Guile moves back unti the jabs stop.  WHen
Guile can no longer jab(several inches) do a magic throw. It can throw
Honda at the begining of the round.  Even if the opponent is throwing a
specail weapon or kicking,punching the magic throw or "touch of death"
brings them down to the ground while GUile is untouched.  You can do it
on Vega when he is climbing the wall. It knocks him off before he jumps
down screamen with arms spread.  He just falls off like you kicked him.
So damn funny. The best most impressive and hardest way to use it is on
a attacking opponent. You can magic throw an atacker as he jump kicks
you. Guile is untouched and the jumper falls helpless to the ground.

By the way if you perfect the magic throw it is impossible for the
opponent to escape. ONce you magic throw him you can repeatldy magic
throw him and he can NOT stand back up. As he is standing back he falls
back to the ground again.

If yo magic throw an opponent with stars the stars are still there when
they get back up unless they are a fast star escaper.  Ducks take longer
to escape from and stars are fast escaping.

I learned how to throw out of the cuffs when Guile is frozen in the
cuffs. You know double bug. I guess when you throw out you are essential
performing a TRIPLE bug at ONE time. Well it is awesome looking. Not
much use but cool.

Finally mastered the fierce,fierce, razor this week. IT is a hell of a
lot better than the fierce,fierce, sonic boom. Only problem is I
sometimes reset the machine doing it. 1 in 20 this happens.

Try this combo. It is not super energy draining like the fier.,fier.
razor but it looks cool.

Fierce, crouching strong, magic throw.  The magic throw gets them
whether they block or dont block.

Try magic throwing Dhalsim when he is flaming. The flame falls to the
ground with him.

Sean can you do the bi-directional magic throw?  I mean a plan old def
to foward one. It has more range than the reversal one. About 1/3 or
more(screen).  hint: Guile must take one step before you do it or it
will throw a sonic boom. Timing is the SUPER CRITICAL facor.  Try
throwing a magic throw and hit roundhouse earlier. You will do the
freeze.  Interesting one step freeze method.  I have figures out the
cuffs from freeze. Works awesome on Vega who slides alot.  Next I am
going to try to magic throw Vega from the freeze.  Dont think it will
work but going to see.

Well heres not a very useful combo but it saves you from embaresment. If
you are playing M.Bison with Guile and do a jab razor and he is about to
throw you as you are coming down.  Do a reset.  For some reason reset
just about always works there.  Even though Guile cant throw Bison first
it seems to work.

AIR CONBINATIONS:

         While jstick is in any direction, fierce punch wait 1/2 sec
         and fierce-punch-again-and-IMMEDIATELY execute fierce fireball.

         (Remember, ..punch-and-IMMEDIATELY.. means as fast as your
          fingers can fly!)

         You can do a similiar combo by replacing the 2nd fierce punch
         with a crouch roundhouse kick.

STRATEGIES/TRICKS:

        When opponents anticipate your fireballs, try to feint
        your fireballs every once in a while.  You can do this in
        numerous ways.  An easy one is to press to simply press the
        jab button.  This might fool an amateur who thinks everytime
        your character on the screen moves a finger a fireball will
        come out.  But against those who actually listen for joystick
        movement and button pressing(fireball sounds), try wiggling
        joystick and pressing the jab.  But against those who are
        seasoned players who actually use their peripheral vision
        to spot that unmistakable fireball jstick movement, then
        move the jstick just like fireball but instead of pressing
        the punch button, hit the kick button.  When they finally
        catch on, then go back to fire-ball-fire-ball-fire-ball..mode.
        Always keep them guessing.

        Avoid using fireball against Blanka unless he is so far away,
        he couldn't reach you.  In this case, if Blanka is far away,
        throw a fireball and walk forward expecting Blanka to jump
        forward over the fireball.  Then at the right distance and
        timing, trip Blanka just as he is landing.  If done correctly
        Blanka's kicks will be a hair length away from your face, and
        Blanka will get tripped.  What happens is that when you crouch
        roundhouse, your character's upper body moves back a little,
        just enough to avoid Blanka's kick but close enough to trip
        him.  This technique can be applied to Honda and Ryu/Ken also.

        Master your dragon punch so that it becomes so natural that
        it almost becomes second nature.   Use your dragon punch to
        counter Guile's crouch kick or back-hand-fist or Dhal's arms
        and leg..etc.  Being vulnerable during an empty dragon punch is
        worth the damage you dish out when you actually make contact.
        Like always, don't be predictable.   When players catch on to
        your dragon punches, they will most likely just sit their
        waiting for your dragon punches.  In this case, execute a
        fireball when previously you would have done a dragon punch.
        Mix it up.

        Dragon punch anyone in the air.  Chunli,Dhal and Guile are most
        vulnerable to this because of their long  hang time.
        When executing a fireball, these characters will most likely
        give you enough time to recover and execute a dragon punch.
        Remember, if the character seems far away to hit him/her with
        a dragon punch, you still have a good chance of hitting if they
        extend a kicking leg.  But good players will anticipate you
        doing this and won't do anything in the air and simply land
        while you miss with the dragon punch, then throw you as you
        come down.  In this case, throw fireball and when they jump
        over, simply walk toward them and throw THEM when they land.

        They'll be expecting to hear "Aaall you can!"(or whatever),
        before they realize they're being thrown in the air.  Obviously,
        they'll catch on to this also, so go back to the previous
        method. Mix it up.

Against Guile.  There are basically two types of Guile modes.

        1) Throws sonic booms every once in a while while waiting to
           razor kick any air assaults. Follows their sonic booms.  And
           tries to maintain that optimal position where if you do a
           fireball, their middle crouch kick or razor kick will hit.

        2) Throws sonic booms a lot and fast.  Follows their sonic
           booms.  This is when your extended fireball stance is hit
           by Guile's backhand-fist(fierce punch) or the crouched
           forward or roundhouse kick.

        Against mode 1), try to avoid being trapped into the 'optimal'
        distance and throw fireball's FAST.  Make him jump over your
        fireballs.  If you have a sneaking suspicion that Guile is
        waiting for a fireball so he can razor kick you, then do a
        middle dragon punch.  A short one might not have a long enough
        hang time to catch the razor kick in the air.

        Against mode 2), this is tougher.  This is where Ryu/Ken must
        jump over the sonic booms to attack Guile.  Most likely you'll
        he roundhoused out of the air.  But you might get a lucky break
        and catch him throwing a sonic boom while you're in the air.
        Try some helicopters to fly over the booms instead of jumping.
        Mix it up.  Do something unexpected like jumpkick and instead
        of crouching with short kicks or a roundhouse kick try jumping
        over him again.  If Guile tries to walk under you to throw,
        use the roundhouse kick in the air.  This kick can catch
        characters walking under you.

        In both modes, try blocking their sonic booms and just as they
        approach you execute a dragon punch, you might catch their
        sweeping leg.  Or if you can't do dragon punches consistently,
        try the roundhouse crouch kick.  You might be able to trip his
        sweeping leg.  You can even use the short crouch kicks
        repeatedly to tag any incoming kicks.

        If your opponent is down to %40 health and is dazed, you can
        finish him/her off by doing a fierce punch dragon punch.
        First approach dazed opponent as close as possible.  Then
        CROUCH(otherwise you'll throw him) fierce punch-and-IMMEDIATELY
        a dragon punch.

Got a new Ryu/Ken bug.  With Ryu or Ken as 1 player let the time get
low.   Put the second player in defensive crouch and hold him there. Get
next to him pressing FOWARD on the 1 player joystick.  With 1 player
stand and do jabs and keep pressing foward as the time runs out.  WHen
the time runs out 1 player will do a winning or losing pose.  The 2
player will STAY crouched if you are still in defensive crouch. Until
you move the joystick the game does not continue.  It just pauses
forever just before the point totals are calculated. Try to do a
hurricane kick on the winning posed 1 player or a razor. If the 1 player
has won then he is in the winning pose as you hit him.  SMASH through
Ryu's smile.

Just got this bug today and got it to work.  Try experimenting.

Blanka
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

AIR COMBINATIONS:

        While jstick is in NEUTRAL position, fierce claw punch wait
        1/2 sec and hit the strong punch button(the middle punch) and-
        IMMEDIATELY-crouch-hit-(middle kick).

        (Blanka's combos are the easiest to execute.  If you are new
         at combinations, do it with Blanka first to get use to the
         timing aspect of the combinations)

        You can do similiar combo's by replacing the fierce claw punch
        with any attack button(fierce claw does more damage though).

STRATEGIES/TRICKS:

        Mix Blanka's combinations so your opponent doesn't know if
        you'll finish the combination or simply walk up and bite
        him/her.

        Try not to be predictable by jumping forward all the time or
        else you'll get walked under and thrown.  Don't jump forward
        everytime a sonic boom or fireball is thrown.  Try jumping
        straight up.  It's very difficult to time those slow boom/balls,
        because of Blanka's short hang time but worth the skill to
        master.

        Blanka is most vulnerable when he falls to the ground and tries
        to get up.  If Guile or Ryu/Ken jumps at you, the crouch fierce
        is a reliable defense.  Beware of the distance though.  At the
        right distance(far but close enough for contact), Guile and
        Ryu/Ken can kick you while you're pressing the fierce button.
        Sometimes Ryu/Ken will come down on you with the short knee
        kick and the crouch fierce punch doesn't work!  That is because
        your opponent timed his jump perfectly.  So a more difficult
        but better defense is Blanka's roll.  When you get knocked down
        immediately assume the roll position with the jstick.  The
        difficult part is timing your roll.  You can help your timing
        by NOT observing your character but the OTHER guy.  Wait until
        Ryu/Ken is JUST about to hit you and then let it fly.  Beware,
        if your opponent has the right distance between him/her and you,
        Blanka's roll can be countered with a kick in the air.
        Blanka's crouched forward middle kick button has priority
        against Guile's infamous crouched forward middle kick button.
        Although Blanka's middle kick doesn't have the reach as Guile's,
        you can hit his outstretched leg and do some significant
        amount of damage.  So if Guile plays the crouch and wait game,
        do the same but slowly creep up to him all the while crouching
        and hitting the middle kick button repeatdly.

        If Guile does his roundhouse tripping kick(the one that comes
        around twice), block the first one and wait until his second
        swing comes around.  Wait until it's just about to hit you and
        use Blanka's roundhouse tripping kick.  If you do it right,
        Guile will get tripped while you won't.  Sometimes you might get
        the timing off and both players will get tripped.


        Remember, Blanka's opponents are most vulnerable against the
        wall.  So if your opponent walks back, walk forward but don't
        jump forward.  Be patient.  If your opponent throws a boom/ball,
        jump straight up or simply block it and continue to advance
        (by walking not jumping forward).  If your opponent doesn't
        give up any ground then it's time to wait for an opening and
        attack.  Otherwise walk them to the wall and then attack.

Blanka:

Thunder Storm     | [| | 0] + Tap[a|b] | Blanka crouches and gains an electric
(Lightning Storm) | [0 |  ]            | aura, anyone who touches it gets
                  |                    | zapped (some moves will strike throug
                  |                    | this.)
Rolling Attack    |[0-| /],-0 + [a|b|c]| Blanka curls into a ball and flies
(Spinning Ball)   |[  |0 ]             | at the opponent. The punch button
                  |                    | used determines how fast he flies.
Spinning Double   | close,0 + c        | Blanka does a forward spin in place,
Claw              |                    | reaching out twice to claw opponent.
                  |                    |
Head Butt         | close,-0 + [a|b]   | Blanka head butts, hitting twice,
                  |                    | once high, once low.
                  |                    |
Knee Jab          | close,-0 + [1|2]   | Blanka knees opponent, hitting twice.
                  |                    | The punch button used determines the
                  |                    | power of the strike.
                  |                    |
Face Bite         | close,-0+c,Tap[c]  | Blanka grabs hold of opponent and
(Face Munch)      |                    | repeatedly bites his/her face until
                  |                    | opponent shakes him off.

Learned a new trick today. Blanka rolls then stops at the person and
bites them.  Got this from USENET today and am going to try it. The guy
swears it true so I will have to see.  Anyway if it works I will post
it.

Please don't take this guide as 'the' way to win, but more of a source
of techniques that can be built on.  I wrote this for those people
who find themselves stuck in a losing pattern.  I stress that anyone
can be beat with a predictable playing pattern.  Mixing up moves is
a good way to win, and makes the fight more interesting.
