GAME SETTING NOTES:
-------------------

Demonstration Mode:
- Plays a normal game of Tempest, but pressing SUPERZAP sends you
  directly to the next level.

Demonstration-Freeze Mode:
- Just like Demonstration Mode, but with frozen screen action.

Both Demonstration Modes:
- Pressing RESET in either mode will cause the game to lock up.
  To recover, set switch 1 to On.
- You can start at any level from 1..81, so it's an easy way of
  seeing what the game can throw at you
- The score is zeroed at the end of the game, so you also don't
  have to worry about artificially high scores disrupting your
  scoring records as stored in the game's EAROM.

Easy Difficulty:
- Enemies move more slowly
- One less enemy shot on the screen at any given time

Hard Difficulty:
- Enemies move more quickly
- 1-4 more enemy shots on the screen at any given time
- One more enemy may be on the screen at any given time

High Scores:
- Changing toggles 1-5 at L12 (more/fewer lives, bonus ship levels)
  will erase the high score table.
- You should also wait 8-10 seconds after a game has been played
  before entering self-test mode or powering down; otherwise, you
  might erase or corrupt the high score table.
