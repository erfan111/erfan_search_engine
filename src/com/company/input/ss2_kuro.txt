THE COMPLEAT KUROKO FAQ (v. 1.5)


Playing CPU Kuroko

There are two ways to get Kuroko:

The first is completely by random. I've gotten him after the third,
fourth, fifth, and other opponents myself. Time, life left, whether
you've continued, human opponents, and any other factors do NOT affect
whether he comes out or not. Once I got him after beating third
opponent Sieger through a timeout, when I had a sliver of life more
than he had. This was a 2-1 match, after I had continued twice already.
So playing quality has NOTHING to do with it!

This second method is sure-fire, and was discovered by Greg Kasavin.
For the 6th, 8th, and 10th opponents, you must beat your opponent in
two rounds. For the second round, you must finish off your opponent
with your Super Move, with under 20 seconds on the clock. Kuroko will
come out after that.
To make this easier, a human player can join in. If either wins 2-0,
winning the second round through the conditions above, Kuroko will
still come out.
Also, a memory card saved at the appopriate opponent WILL work. So home
players can get Kuroko easily by loading the saved position, and beating
a "dummy" player while satisfying the conditions.


How to beat Kuroko

General tactics Kuroko uses--this is on my system, and I don't know if
the CPU uses the same strategy in other systems, but I don't see why
not.
Most of the time, Kuroko advance toward you, or throw fireballs if
you are far away. If you try to jump him, he will often hit you first
with his ground slash, or leap into the air and hit you with an air
slash. If you throw a fireball, he will often reflect it. If you do
special moves, he will often retaliate with his chain extension. When
he's hit, he will often do the "split" trick.
I've noticed these two tactics he initiates:
1) Kuroko rolls in and tries to AB slash or throw you. He will often do
this if you try making quick, non-low attacks against him; i.e. he rolls
through your attack and hits you. A variant on this is when he sends out
his electrical sphere, then rolls under it and tries to throw you.
2) Kuroko jumps at you, almost always with his C kick. As soon as he
lands he either does an AB slash or throws you.
When Kuroko's powered up, watch out. He will run up, then slide toward
you. If you try ANY counterattack, he will cream you with his Super. If
you block, he will keep on trying to slide into you, ticking off points.
He will eventually throw you if he can't hit you with the Super. I'm not
sure how to counter this. However, if he hits you, you will often be
powered up afterwards (assuming you're still alive). Kuroko does NOT move
after hitting you, so while going through your "mad" animation, you have
a free throw against him while he's right next to you.

To beat him, play conservatively most of the time. He seems to be
the weakest in the air, because he insists on doing the C kick, even
though his AB slash is much better. Also, I can get hit with the kick,
yet STILL hit him in the air after that.
Note that Kuroko doesn't have any low attacks except for his short-ranged
crouch kicks. So you don't have to crouch all the time.

Here's an almost sure-fire way to win with Charlotte: for most of the
time, just thrust him to keep him away. Watch out, as he can hit you
first occasionally with his AB slash. You will get backed into a corner.
Kuroko will then start jumping at you--when he does, jump and AB him.
You will get hit by his C kick first, but you can still jump up and
cream him with your AB afterwards.
If he splits into two, I can crouch AB the first one and still recover
in time if it's the wrong half.
You can't do anything about the fireballs he throws--they're too fast or
big.
Don't try jumping him unless you're desperate. Like Mizuki, he seems to
eat the first AB triangle, but learns after that.
After practicing, I can beat him 2-0 with Charlotte frequently, and I
think this strategy will work with any character with quick air attacks.

For those that don't but have a fairly slow jump, try the Kyoshiro strategy
instead.
For Kyoshiro, I fend off Kuroko with standing B-slashes. I eventually get
backed into a corner. When Kuroko jumps up and does his C kick, jump
straight up and get hit with it. It does little damage, and when Kuroko
lands, he still does his AB slash. By the time Kyoshiro lands, he can throw
the recovering Kuroko. This strategy works because Kyoshiro does a lot of
throwing damage against Kuroko, for some reason, so Kyoshiro comes out
ahead.


Playing human Kuroko

This will work for home Neo Geo systems only.
You can only play him in a two player game. You cannot load any saved
positions either.
After either player wins, the game ends. Whoever wins gets his/her face
shown on the "Game Over" screen, just as if he had won a normal game.

To get Kuroko with either joystick, enter this code, courtesy of Geese
Howard:

    O  |  O-  O  |  -O + A (i.e. hold the joystick forward and press A)
    |  O      |  O

The joystick movements are the same for EITHER side--don't reverse them!
Note you can play a mirror match with Kuroko. However, Kuroko doesn't
have an alternate color, so the two will look exactly the same!


Kuroko facts:
Kuroko cannot have his weapons broken or lost in a clash.
Kuroko cannot be thrown normally. He is thrown just like Earthquake.
Note this still can do substantial damage!
Kuroko can still be SPDed by the ninjas.
Kuroko can be dizzied.
If you split Kuroko in two, anatomical (not valentine's) hearts spill
out.

Notes: The most useful fireballs are the Haohshokohken (HUGE--hard to
jump over) and the Mega Smash (very fast). The Electrical Sphere is
slow, and useful for setting up throws (like Hanzo's A slinky).
The Sembei Toss and Electrical Sphere do not come out consistently at
all, while the Double Kohken and Flag Extension can be easily mixed up,
since their joystick movements are similar.
To do the two moves consistently, try this: move the joystick B, DB, B,
but NOT D. For the Flag Extension, move the joystick DF, D, DB,
B. Basically, avoid doing a normal quarter circle either way.
Despite the similar appearance to Mizuki's Curse Ball, the Electrical
Sphere does normal damage and does NOT turn you into a pig.
You can be hit after doing the Death Fake, if your opponent picks the
right one to hit.
Kuroko seems to have very high throw priority.
Kuroko's Power Special is not easy to spot, because he slides toward
you without any big warning. You can block it, taking a hit of blocking
damage, but if you don't he nails you with his Super Combo. This move
also does major damage, unlike a lot of other Power Specials.
