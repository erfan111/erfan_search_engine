| Parms which have question marks ("?") mean that I don't know what they     |
| REALLY are: I received a document which explained them, but it was sort-of |
| bogus: It stated a 16 colour mode had -1- bitplane: Strange. I'm not even  |
| sure about MODE 6; but, we know what MODE 7 is, even if i'm not sure how   |
| many playfields it has.                                                    |

| I have personally tested MODE 0 and MODE 1. MODE 3 I might test in the     |
| future sometime...                                                         |
