                                 -----------

                     What everyone has been waiting for!

                                     THE
                   MEGADRIVE/GENESIS EMULATOR FOR THE AMIGA
                   ----------------------------------------
                         From Advanced Emulation Ltd.


It's taken long enough to evolve..  infact over 6 months intensive programming
has finally seen the first release of the "AmigaDrive emulator".

Considering  the  Megadrive and Amiga contain a very similar architecture - it
was only a matter of time before this emulator appeared.

I  mean,  considering  the  Amiga  can  emulate  IBM's,  MAC's,  C64's, BBC's,
Spectrums,  QL's  etc....   most  with  completely  different  processors, the
Megadrive one seems simple in comparison.  (Although it certainly isn't!)

The  real  surprise  is that no other attempt has been made in the time of the
Megadrive's release.


                                 INTRODUCTION
                                 ------------

First  off,  we  won't  bore  you  with  the  technical specifications of this
emulator,  but  will  highlight  the  main  objectives  and  features  of this
software...

* TO BRING THE MEGADRIVE WORLD TO THE AMIGA - FOR UNDER £100!

* TO RUN MEGADRIVE CARTRIDGES FROM FLOPPY OR HARD DISK DRIVE.

* TO RUN MEGA-CD GAMES VIA ANY CD-ROM DEVICE, AND THE FORTHCOMING A570 CD-ROM
  INTERFACE FROM COMMODORE.

* TO ALLOW YOU TO SAVE/LOAD AND EDIT GAMES, IN MUCH THE SAME WAY AS THE "SUPER
  MAGIC DRIVE" BACK-UP SYSTEM ALREADY AVAILABLE ALLOWS.

* TO RUN SOFTWARE AS FAST AS POSSIBLE ON AN AMIGA MACHINE..
  AN AMIGA 500 REACHES APPROX 60-65% SPEED.. A 68030 CAN ATTAIN 95% OR MORE.

 PLUS -- THIS EMULATOR IS TOTALLY BRITISH CODED! NO HONG KONG STUFF HERE!! :-)


                                  EMULATION
                                  ---------

THE 68000 CODE IS OF COURSE EMULATED (?) WITH THE AMIGAS OWN 68000 PROCESSOR.

THE  Z80  IS ALSO EMULATED BY THE 68000.  (Naturally there is therefore a slow
down, especially when attempting to run Mega-CD games and SCALING).


THE MEGADRIVES SOUND IS EMULATED AS FOLLOWS:

THE  "CHIP  MUSIC"  CHANNELS ARE SPLIT IN THE SAME WAY AS OTHER MUSIC PROGRAMS
WORK, SUCH AS "OKTALYZER", "TFMX", "STARTREKKER" ETC, BUT EVEN MORE SO AS ONLY
THE FIRST 2 CHANNELS ARE 'SPLIT' THIS WAY.  A SLIGHT LOSS IN QUALITY OBVIOUSLY
OCCURS.   THE  REMAINING 2 "SAMPLE" CHANNELS WORK AS NORMAL WITH THE OTHER TWO
AMIGA SOUND CHANNELS.

One  drawback  is  that  the sound quality is reduced even more than the music
programs  mentioned  above,  as  to  keep  enough processor time for the other
emulation.   However  if you have heard the Megadrives sound quality, you will
know  that the samples are pretty poor anyway.  Blame Commodore for not having
a 8 or 16 channel sound chip!!


THE  MEGADRIVES  64  COLOURS  ARE  OBTAINED BY UTILISING THE AMIGAS HALF BRITE
MODE.    (THIS   WILL   THEREFORE   LOOK  TOTALLY  WRONG  ON  AN  AMIGA  1000)
UNFORTUNATELY,  WITH  THE  WAY THE PALETTE WORKS, SOME COLOURS WILL NOT APPEAR
CORRECT.   YOU  CAN  OPT  FOR  HAM  MODE  SCREEN EMULATION WHICH WILL GIVE THE
CORRECT  PALETTES  -  FRINGING WILL BE MINIMISED BY CONTINUOUSLY ADJUSTING THE
PALETTE ON EACH SCAN-LINE, (LIKE NEWTEK'S DYNAMIC HI-RES & ASDG'S HAM-8 MODES)

NB:   THIS  IS  NOT POSSIBLE ON THE 68000 VERSION.  INFACT EVEN WITH THE 680X0
VERSION,  ANYTHING  BELOW A 25MHZ 68030 WILL PROBABLY STRAIN TO DO THIS AT ANY
GOOD  SPEED.   ESPECIALLY  CONSIDERING  THE  HARDWARES  LIMITATION  ON  SCREEN
UPDATING.  WE BELIEVE THE EHB OPTION IS MORE THAN SATISFACTORY ANYWAY.

THE  MEGA-CD'S  SCALING/ROTATION  CAPABILITY MEANS THE EMULATOR WILL SLOW DOWN
*QUITE  CONSIDERABLY* WITHOUT AN ACCELERATOR.  THEREFORE A FASTER PROCESSOR IS
THOROUGHLY RECOMMENDED, IF NOT VITAL.


                              MEGA-CD OPERATION
                              -----------------

As  is  probably  already  known,  the  current  Mega-CD  units  have  special
protection  to  stop you being able to run say a Japanese CD on an European/UK
Megadrive.  We have overcome this, by automatically detecting which country of
origin  the  CD  is  from  (by  reading  the  CD  header  information like the
Mega-CD)..   and  switching  the Amigadrive to that country, that is Japanese,
American or European.  We have found this to be pretty much successful.

We will be releasing update "modules" for any game that still fails to run.

The  CD-Rom options have been tested on Philips and Goldstar CD-Rom units, and
we  are  writing  the routines to work with the forthcoming A570 (formally the
A690)  CD  drive.   Until  the  A570  is  released  we  cannot ensure its 100%
compatibilty,  but  it  is expected to be launched before the final version of
the Mega-CD software is released.

We  also  hope to get the software to work with the Xetec CD-Rom system in the
near future.

The  software for running the Mega-CD is sold separate to the main package and
will be sold for £75 Including VAT.


                             MINIMUM REQUIREMENTS
                             --------------------

To run the AmigaDrive emulator, you will need the following:

AMIGA COMPUTER (!) WITH 1.5 MEGS OF RAM. (KS1.2 or above)
FAT AGNUS (THE MACHINE MUST RUN IN 60HZ [NTSC] MODE)

AN AMIGA 500 WILL BE NEEDED IF USING THE A570 OPTION.
ALL AMIGAS :  A PHILIPS OR GOLDSTAR CD-ROM UNIT FOR RUNNING MEGA-CD SOFTWARE.

The following are thoroughly recommended:

Faster processor; 68020/30/40 (almost vital for running Mega-CD games)
                  and maths co-pro for mathematical work (Scaling/rotation)

Hard Drive; to store games.



                              RUNNING THE GAMES
                              -----------------

The  games  can  be  run from disk, but of course firstly need to be converted
from cartridge format to disk.

We  will be supplying our own adaptor to allow you to transfer the ROM data to
the Amiga via Parallel.  This will be sold at approximately £20 including VAT.

You  can  alternatively make your own adaptor, which will consist more or less
of  an  IC  socket,  parallel cable and little else.  The requirements will be
made  available to the public domain as it becomes available, and can be built
for approx £5.

You  can  also  directly run the cartridge with the adaptor, without saving to
disk (if you have just a floppy system for instance.)

Once  the game is put on disk, a menu system allows you to load the games from
floppy  or hard disk (using a fully windowed environment) and execute them.  A
monitor  is  included  on the professional version of the emulator and you can
save the game at any point (like an Action Replay).

It  is also possible to also modify the games with cheat modes etc..  with our
built  in  "cheat mode finder" option, similar to that used in Datel's "Action
Replay" for the Megadrive and the forthcoming "Game Genie".

The  professional  version  of  the AmigaDrive will also let you code your own
Megadrive  software.   However  the  official  documentation  is only given to
authorised  Sega  developers,  and  so  you  will  have  to become one, or get
friendly with someone who is!  ..  or learn by trial and error!

                            ESTIMATED RELEASE DATE
                            ----------------------

The  AMIGA-Drive Emulator should be available from May 1st 1992, and will come
complete with main AmigaDrive software, consisting of normal 68000 version and
enhanced 680X0 6888X version.

Distribution will be made direct from Advanced Emulation Ltd.  Trade enquiries
welcome.


                                     COST
                                     ----

The AmigaDrive software will be sold for £99.
The Professional version will be sold for £150.

The Mega-CD software will be sold for £75 - please note, as stated in the text
above,  an accelerator with maths co-processor is recommended, as the standard
68000 is trying to run TWO 68000 processors in parallel!

The  Cartridge adaptor is £20.  But the diagrams will be made public domain if
you wish to build your own.

These  prices  include  VAT,  but  ARE  NOT  finalised.   Full details will be
available later in April.


                             FUTURE DEVELOPMENTS
                             -------------------

A  future  version  may  very  well  be  as  a hardware version, with separate
versions for the A500, A600 and A1500-3000 series.

We  are  also closely looking at a Super Nintendo emulator, although this will
be  virtually impossible to do through software, and will almost definately be
hardware.
