Why not a FAQ? --------------------------------------------------------------
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Somebody else already did a FAQ.
The FAQ contains all the arcade moves, fatalities, etc..
Mine only has SNES specific codes, cheats, etc...


-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Secret Select codes ---------------------------------------------------------
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
These codes work in 1 Player mode only. (except for "extend fatality time")

You can combine any code that doesn't involve getting to a secret character.
In other words, if you do the code to get to Kintaro, then do the code to get
to Smoke, you will just end up fighting Smoke.

While at the screen where you choose your character, push the following
directions followed by select. You can do it anytime before both players have
chosen their character. As soon as you hit select after doing the movements,
you will hear the same exact sound that you hear when you choose your
character (same pitch and everything). If you are not hearing the sound after
pressing select, try it faster (you have to be fast). You can also combine
any code except for the ones that involve skipping to secret characters. For
example you can fight Shao Kahn and win with an uppercut and a jump kick
(Super Strength + Fight Shao Kahn).


Example: Down-Up-Right-Up-Left-Select will give you super strength.

D U R U L = Super Strength- CPU only. Your hits 4X damage, their's 1/4 damage
L U R D L = 30 Kredits
U U L U D = Extends time to do the fatality/friendship/babality/pit/spikes
R U U R L = Skip to Shao Kahn. Just as if you got there legally.

The following codes work as follows. You play the named character, and you
play them forever until you lose (get the "push start to continue" screen).
At that point you play someone else, then play the game normally (as in playing
against Shang Tsung until you win the game) just as if you got there legally.

U L U U R = Skip to Smoke,                   then play from Shang Tsung.
U D D L R = Skip to Jade, then smoke,        then play from Shang Tsung.
L U D D R = Skip to Noob Saibot, then Smoke, then play from Shang Tsung.
U D D R R = Skip to Kintaro,                 then play from Shao Kahn.

hey dummy, don't forget to hit select after the movements!


-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Alternative intro to game ---------------------------------------------------
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Hold L and R buttons, then reset game. hold buttons until screen turns red.
Shao Kahn comes out, points, taunts, Kintaro comes out, stomps logo, Kahn
points again, game starts. See it for yourself!


-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Tournament mode -------------------------------------------------------------
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Hold L and R buttons and hit start at title screen (where you can choose
between starting, or options) to get into a 4 person endurance match. Choose
your character by hitting left and right (hit select to get random select).
When you lose, the next character you chose pops down and you fight them
until you lose all 4 characters.
Note that they always jump in from the side they started in. So after you kill
on of their players, you can snatch them out of the air if you're Jax or
Scorpion. But they can do the same to you if you're not careful. As soon as
you jump in, you can do a move 'in the air' before you hit the ground. Kung
Lao's aerial kick is really good for this. Well, you get the idea. There are
a lot of strategies involving the time that the character jumps in.

Bug: Getting to smoke in this mode is very strange. Instead of fighting
Smoke, you will fight the first fighter of your opponent's 4 fighters, and
then the other 3 will either hold a direction on their controller (eg. they
will duck the entire round), or just stand there and let you waste them.

Reminder: Random select in this mode -- hit the select button.

OCF's Mortal Kombat II Game Genie Codes
by Orlando C. Fernando (ocfernan@mailbox.syr.edu)
SNES Version 4.0
Last Updated: 11/29/94

Codes have been tested.  Additional "safe" effects may be possible, esp. w/
character specifics' finishing move codes.  CPU stands for the 
computer opponent.  Names in [] brackets indicate outsiders that discovered a 
certain "side effect" from the code (bulleted by the dash).  
Interruptible's are codes whose move effects can be interrupted in 
mid-execution.  Some code effects are harder (intermediate) or very hard 
(expert) to use, but useable nonetheless. The codes all took a long time 
for me to come up with, so go crazy with 'em folks!

This will probably be the final major version of this FAQ, unless I 
stumble on some earth-shattering boss code or something in the near 
future (in my dreams!).

SINCE LAST UPDATE (3.0):
	-45 new functional codes added (indicated by ! following code).
	-new effects/warning found for older codes 78, 128, and 152. 
	-"In the Works" replaced with "Imperfect Codes," codes left entirely
	 for you to play with if you want to perfect them...and there are 
	 QUITE a few juicy ones that demand more modification!
	-short "Programming Basic Tips" included for any future code-breakers
	 out there destined to find a Kintaro code, Akuma code, or whatever :I

			 even inflict damage on himself!

			 with certain special moves

			 (Player 1) bicycle kick while 'being' Scorpion 
			 (as player 2)..."

			 near victim upon Finishing Move time

			-doing reverse invisibility (the move twice) gives
			 you "shadow" invisibility.  
			-other Reptile oddities (Liu Kang's Bicycle Kick
			 won't make Reptile reappear, possible to do

			 stuck until hit <FROWN>, but is excellent for doing

			 morphing to Jax, setting wave (in front of or behind
			 victim), and doing another morph's fatality (e.g.,
			 Tsung's "Soul" & Baraka's "Torture" displaces victim)

OCF79	4960-3DAE	Kung Lao's Hat Throw has longer recovery (if connects)
OCF80	57E9-CD0A	Smokin' Kung Lao
			-do hat throw to get "charged," wait until you're hit.
			-[David] Hat throw close to opponent may cause 
			 "spontaneous combustion" (declared a "fatality" 
			 at round's end if you win!)
			-[Trent] Odd reactions by opponents after explosion.
OCF81	57E9-C4AA	Kung Lao's New Stun Beam! (vs. CPU) (do hat throw)  
			-New possible combos:  (Safe) Jump Kick - Stun Beam - 
			 Teleport w/ Kick; 
			 (Risky) Jump Kick - Stun Beam - Whirlwind Spin
OCF82	51E9-CD0A	Kung Lao's New Levitator! (do hat throw, get hit)

			-turn off to resume normal hat throw if desired
			-Levitated Teleport will oddly glitch, but opponent
			 can eventually punch him out of it.

			 his feet, Johnny Cage nut punches his heads off then
			 Lao lands in his hands, etc.)

			 direction (e.g. for Rayden: Quarter Circle -
			 LOW PUNCH - LOW PUNCH)

OCF138	AAB9-4D64	Reptile's "Tongue" & Johnny Cage's "Torso" Fatalities
			Has Funny "Disappearing Acts" (not like code 102's)
OCF139	203B-C7F7	Decapitation Fatalities Altered (Johnny
			Cage, Kitana, Baraka)
			-do Cage's "3 Header" on victim at or near corner
			(at is best!) for "Take It Outside"
			-otherwise, Cage does "Look Ma, No Heads!"

			victim disappear!
OCF140	9F38-C4F7	Decapitation Fatalities Leave a Frozen Body Part

			(Johnny Cage, Kitana, Liu Kang, Reptile, etc.)
			-Don't do Johnny Cage's "3 Header" Fatality

OCF150	81E7-CF0A	Fatality causes a spazz-out until you do another
			 non-fatality move (e.g., special move, friendship)

Imperfect Codes:
----------------

OCF151	1720-37AE	Mileena's Teleport Kick produces Roll Combo!!!...then 
			blacks out.  Suspected that changing the first two 
			digits in code may unglitch it.  Any volunteers to try?

OCF152	E3B7-EF76	Sounds like Rap Music (mostle just drums, effect/words
			rapped), tends to blackout upon uppercuts, Force Ball 
			hits, choosing Tournament, and possibly other actions.

OCF153	E4E8-3FAA!	Baraka/Johnny Cage's Projectiles Can Produce Fighting
			 Doppleganger!! (20% change of blackout)
			-should turn off once produced dopple until next round.
			-don't use Tsung's, the ninja's, Jax's, Kang's, nor
			 Mileena's projectiles until dopple is "activated".
			-subsequent projectiles (from anyone if Shang Tsung)
			 can recreate different ground & air dopples.
			-TIP VS. CPU: set dopple in corner, hit CPU so that
			 he/she bumps into dopple.  Dopple will do throws,
			 throw projectiles, or even do multi-hit juggle combos!
			-odd occurences during fatalities if dopple is around.
			-can get stuck at times, but still playable.

OCF154	6FB9-C797!	Loser can still fight during Finishing Move Time!! /
			 No Fatalities
			-very similar to the code discovered by Neto San
			-amusing for Shao Kahn matches.
			-works best when combined with "fatality every round"
			 code B2B8-3D6E (may freeze without this 2nd code)
			 and/or Player 1 always wins each match
			-simpler alternative is to turn on only during
			 winning match for either player.
			-both winner and loser can do their friendships!
			-loser can stop you from doing your friendship
			 even if completed, & it's declared a "Fatality"!
			-if attack "Babality" baby, will turn back to adult!
			-if no finishing move is successfully performed, CPU
			 can beat up on you.
			-doing finishing move at last possible moment may
			 cause game freeze.
			-loser not receiving finishing move nor not attacking
			 winner may also cause game freeze in 2-player game.

PROGRAMMING BASIC TIPS:
-----------------------
1) Play around with first 2 digits of an existing code.
2) When testing, play as Shang Tsung and do different morphed character's 
	special moves and finishing moves to experiment.
3) Enter published codes B2B8-3D6E (finish every round) and DDB5-1FF7 
	(Player 2 quick kill) to test finishing moves quicker.
4) Remember that on some occasion, several codes can cause just 1 effect.
5) Mix 1st 4 digits with one existing code with the last 4 digits of another.

Bugs/Glitches that keep the game interesting --------------------------------
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
These are fun things you can try to keep the game fun. The one's that also
work in the arcade aren't included here. Or at least I haven't tried them in
the arcade! :)

    Players: This means who you have to be, and who the victim has to be.
Description: How to do the bug and other comments.


*** in order of newness to this list ***

(part of this also works in the arcade)
    Players: Any male ninja (Sub-zero, Scorpion, Reptile), Baraka, Lui Kang
             vs. Anybody
Description: If you kill the victim with a throw, the victim can get off any
move, special move (including morphing), friendship, babality, or dead pool
just before going into their death stagger (where they just look like they
are loosing their balance waiting for you to kill them). You can't do a
fatality, pit/spikes or babality, but any special move will work. If the
victim does a friendship/babality, the winner is free to move around and bash
them out of it, or anything except a fatality/ babality or pit/spikes.
  -- There are many possiblities with this.
* Pick shang tsung and morph into someone who can do the throwing, and you can
morph into someone else after they are dead. Then you can do many combonations
of double friendships.
* Have the winner be Scorpion, and since you have to kill them with a throw, try
the air throw! This means you haven't hit any punches and both players can get
off a friendship/babality.
* Reptile's invisibility works. So you can pick reptile, and have an invisible
person kill Reptile. Or try using the shang tsung trick, and turn into
Raiden, have the victim turn invisible, and do Raiden's uppercut fatality
(you will never even see reptile die).
* Dead pool. Nuff said.
* <NEW!!> If the loser is  Kung Lao, do the shield move (just rap really fast
on up and LK) and have the winner get smashed by it. You can do the move
again and again! If Kung Lao didn't hit punch, you can do the shield move,
and if you hit your opponent with it immediatly, Kung Lao can do the
friendship/babality right right after.

<NEW>
    Players: Anybody vs. Shao Kahn
Description: If you win by running out of time, he will just snap into his
winning pose after the first screen flash.
Variations: If you make it run out of time when Shao Kahn in in the air, and
you end up being the winner, provided the move you did to put Shao Kahn in the
air does not kill him, it will crash.
Notes: Previous FAQs said that only Katana's fan lift would do this, but any
move that sends Shao Kahn into the air will crash it.

    Players: Baraka or Kitana vs. Kintaro
Description: If you do Baraka's blade fury or Kitana's fan throw to Kintaro
while he is in the corner, he won't land. I think this works in the arcade
too.

    Players: Sub-zero vs. Computer or Human anybody
Description: ** This one is a rewrite of a bug that was in here before. **
Win with Sub-zero. Make it so you're fairly close the the center of the stage.
Do the perma-freeze, then jump over them and do it again. Look behind you,
see it? If not, jump away from them, then towards (so that the screen scrolls
back so you can see more), then do the perma-freeze again. See it? The idea
here is to do the freeze, then get on the other side of them and make it so
that you can see what's way behind them. There is the freeze going
in the opposite direction. Do it and you'll see what I mean. Notice the area
where the perma-freeze hits them. It doesn't "bounce" off them where the ice
is hitting their body. This is probably what that is behind you.
You can correct this by doing it the perma-freeze normally, but as far away as
possible. Don't jump over them or anything, just do it, but as far as
possible without being so far that you can't do it. (redundant, but you know
how some people are!)

    Players: Shang Tsung vs. Lui Kang
Description: At 'finish him' morph into Sub-zero, perma freeze until you morph
back, then morph into Jax, then do head-pop fatality. His color map will be
screwed up, and Lui Kang's body will look extra bloody.

    Players: Scorpion vs. Anybody
Description: After doing the harpoon, you can usually do another one that is
not blockable. Even works against the computer!

    Players: Raiden vs. Anybody
Description: This is extremely hard to do, but since it's consistent, I
decided to include it. If Raiden is his at the same time as he is warping,
he will appear wherever he warps to in his 'getting hit' animation. If you
warp unscathed, you did it too soon. If you simple get hit, you did it too
late. Looks great with Baraka's blade fury or Sub-zero's ground freeze.
Missile weapons are easiest to do this trick with (letting Raiden get hit
with the missile weapon of course).

    Players: Jax vs. Jax
Description: If you do his arm ripoff fatality, the victim's arms won't land.

    Players: Jax vs. Raiden
Description: If you do his arm ripoff fatality, Kung Lao's arms will appear
instead of Raiden's.

    Players: Reptile vs. Shao Kahn
Description: Win the game with Reptile. But be invisible. Instead of doing
his pose, he will just stay invisible.

    Players: Anybody vs. Shao Kahn
Description: If you win by running out of time, he says "No, No, No!" even
though he's frozen in time from running out of time.

    Players: Shang Tsung vs. human or computer
Description: Morph into Sub-zero. Wait until the last second before you morph
back, then freeze the ground. After you morph back into Shang Tsung,
immediately do single-flaming skulls really fast (tap back and HP really
fast). This causes the ground freeze to disappear (which is a SNES bug in
itself) and the Flaming skull will turn into Kung Lao for a second, or
flaming skull will disappear (among other strange things).

    Players: Shang Tsung vs. Computer (anybody, even hidden characters)
Description: When the computer is kind of far away, do single flaming skulls
really fast. If they don't just keep ducking, you're doing it too slow. After
a time (it can happen anytime from a second to a minute) they will just slide
across the screen at you in their ducking pose! Try it to see what I mean.

    Players: Lui Kang vs. Human Anybody (works for me best with Cage)
Description: Have victim continuously jump straight up. Charge up the bicycle
kick. This takes some timing. If you can high-punch them AS they are jumping
up, and immediately do a bicycle kick, they will go very very high up and you
will see the ceiling. This crashes the game often.

    Players: Baraka or Kitana vs. Kintaro
Description: Baraka and Kitana are the only one's I know that can do it.
Maybe others can, I don't know. All you have to do, is kill Kintaro any
round with either the blade fury or a fan throw making Kintaro land in the
corner. The bug is that Kintaro won't land, he'll just be half-fallen.

    Players: Baraka, Jax, Lui Kang vs. Computer anybody
Description: This is more of a stupid-computer bug. Just continuously keep
doing Baraka's blade spark, Reptile's spit, Jax's Energy Wave, or Lui Kang's
low-fireball (but they usually block it), and the computer will keep jumping
away, and into your projectile like a moron.
