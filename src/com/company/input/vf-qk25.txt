  This guide is a much shorter version than the complete guide.  The getting  
 started section as well as the techniques guide have been cut in order to  
 provide you, the gamer, with the shortest possible listing of all known  
 moves to date.  See vf-pg25.txt for a one page format of this QFAQ. 
   
  If you have need of more help than just character's moves, see the complete 
 guide (vf-25.txt).  You can obtain it on net news (posted every friday), by  
 anonymous ftp from ftp.netcom.com under pub/vi/vidgames/faqs (special thanks to  
 Andy Eddy of GamePro mag), or by fingering the e-mail address above. 
 
 All changes, additions, or suggestions:  e-mail to the address at the top 
					  of this article. 
   
  ------------- 
  special notes   
  ------------- 
   There is a real difference between "," and "+" in this FAQ.  For example,  
  "D+K" _must_ be done as a tap to the joystick down and simultaneously  
  pressing the K button.  On the other hand, a "D,K" could be done by  
  tapping the joystick down and pressing K or _also_ by holding the joystick  
  down and then pressing the K button. 
   This is only most notably important in the snap kicks, backflips, and  
  kickflips which require a tap of the joystick in conjunction with possibly  
  pressing the button. 
 
   The "heel kicks","sweeps", and "knees" that have not been witnessed and  
  are still marked w/ a -?- in the complete guide will now be removed from 
  the QFAQ to conserve space. 
   
  All new moves will now me noted by a "*". 
   
  All moves which can be done while still holding defend are marked with a {D} 
  All moves which hit a standing defender are marked with an {S} 
  All moves which hit a crouching defender are marked with a {C} 
   
  Check out the complete guide, theres a lot of other stuff there.

  On to the moves!!!
