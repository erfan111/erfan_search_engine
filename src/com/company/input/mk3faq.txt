			       Points of Interest
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This will be little (insignificant to the fighting part) things like slipping 
off the spikes in the Kombat Tomb, Smoke and Jade in the Living Forest, and "Oh 
Whoa!" (from The Dead Pool).  Those little touches really set MK apart, I think.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
			       Kombatant Stories
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Here is where the Kombatant bios will go.  I'll include each intro, along with 
each ending as soon as I get them.

** Jackson Briggs **

Jax is back for more action in MK3.  He looks pretty much the same, however, he
now has cybernetic arms. These are apparently the result of having his original
arms ripped off by Shang Tsung in the second tournament...

** Kano **

Held captive during the second tournament, Kano is hungry for Outworld blood.
One of his fatalities is rumored to involve the removal of his opponent's 
skeleton through his/her mouth...nice!

** Kung Lao **

Another returning Kombatant, Kung Lao has been redesigned for the third tourney
as well.  His trademark hat remains for all you Kung Lao groupies!

** Liu Kang **

Essentially unchanged, Liu Kang is back for his third try...maybe he can end up
with two out of three?

** Sonya Blade **

Sonya returns with Kano, and is now portrayed by Kerri Hoskins, the famous NBA
JAM cheerleader.  She's got some new moves as well.  Hope she's got a better
fatality...

** Cyrax **

The famous "Robo-Ninja" pitted against Liu Kang in a preview picture floating
around the Internet.  Apparently, it is a part of Sub-Zero's former clan, sent
to eliminate him after his departure.

** Sektor **

A red "Robo-Ninja," who, with his yellow counterpart Cyrax, are ordered to 
assassinate Sub-Zero.  Hmm...the Ryu and Ken for the next century?

** Night Wolf **

A Native American who was somehow immune to Shao Kahn's takeover, Night Wolf is
an impressive looking "Indian for the 90's."  He is played by Midway's Sal
Divita.

** Kurtis Stryker **

Stryker is a Special Weapons And Tactics officer enlisted to help defeat Shao
Kahn and his army.  Kurt uses a night stick and grenades to attack.

** Sheeva **

Sheeva is the much awaited _playable_ half-human-half-dragon being.  A female
version of Goro, she is sure to be a favorite of Goro fans.  Hmm...this isn't
a Hindu reference, is it?

** Sindel **

Shao Kahn's bride makes her first appearance in the third installment of the
Mortal Kombat Series.  Originally killed ten thousand years ago on Earth, she
is reincarnated when the Outworld spills over into ours.

** Kabal **

Kabal survived the takeover by Shao Kahn as well.  However, Kabal was attacked
shortly after by Kahn's troops.  He was severly injured, but not killed.  His
costume reflects the fact that he was badly mutilated in the attack.  He seeks
revenge for the pain caused by Shao Kahn.

** Shang Tsung **

Another familiar face, Tsung is altered a little too.  The beanie is gone, his
black hair is long again, and the trademark goatee/Fu Manchu remains.  He 
also retained his morphing power.

** Sub Zero **

Probably the most popular of the Mortal Kombat characters (in terms of number
of times played), Sub-Zero has returned for his second tournament (the Sub-Zero
from the first tourney disappeared).  However, he is no longer a ninja.  The
costume has been removed, but he still dresses in blue.  Sub-Zero is being 
hunted in this tournament as well...what exactly did this poor guy do to
deserve all this attention?

** Jade **

No info at this time.

** Smoke **

No info at this time.

		    Other Mortal Kombat Internet Resources
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Several other resources for Mortal Kombat information are available around the 
net. Here are a few:

WWW Sites:

* The WWW Mortal Kombat Pages *
http://www.cs.ucl.ac.uk/students/zcacaes/mk/mk.html

These pages are maintained by Antony Espindola.  In my opinion, this is one of
the best resources.  He updates it almost daily (especially since the Beta
version is out!), and has great pictures, as well as many links to other WWW
games sites.  You can find info on practically any aspect of the game.  Antony
is also a friend of Ed Boon's, or pen pal at least, and usually has pretty 
reliable info.  No rumors here, except in the Gossip section.


* The Mortal Kombat 3 Site *
http://198.49.168.5/~mkruse/mk3/mk3.html

Maintained by Matt Kruse at St. Ambrose University, these pages are the ultimate
place to go to find the latest info on our favorite game.  Highlights include
the graphical representation of moves, MK-related raytraced artwork by Matt, 
and virtually all the MK3 FAQs.  This one also gets emphatic recommendation.


* Game FAQs by FTP *
ftp://ftp.netcom.com/pub/vi/vidgames/faqs

Need a FAQ for a game?  You can find it here.  Can't find it here?  It doesn't
exist.  That pretty much says it all.  Andy Eddy, Senior Editor of GamePro 
magazine, has generously made his account at netcom available to the Internet
at large.  Thanks, Andy!


* The Fighting Game Archive *
ftp://brawl.mindlink.com/pub/fighting

Here you can find all sorts of guides, trivia, fan fiction, pictures, fake
pictures (thanks, Jenn!), and just about anything you can think of relating to
fighting games in general.  I'm not sure who maintains this site, but it's
pretty nice.


* The Mortal Kombat Digest *

Last but not least, there's The Mortal Kombat Digest.  Intended as a forum for
intelligent discussion (read: NO HU GO!) about Mortal Kombat 3 and the other
games in the series, the MKD is maintained by John Coleman. (Hey! I know that 
guy!)  Originally, the MKD was slated to go out every day or so, and this could
still happen in the next few months.  Revisions to this FAQ will be included
with every issue.  Hopefully, in the next few weeks/months, the Digest will be
swamped with mail from people wanting to discuss the game in a more intelligent
manner than what's been going on on alt.games.mk recently.

To subscribe to the Mortal Kombat Digest, send email in this format:

To: coleman@hopwood.lynchburg.edu
From: (self explanatory!)
Subject: Subscribe MKD
Body of message:

your email address

That's it.  Pretty simple.  If you want to post something to the Digest, such as
a move you'd like confirmed, or maybe a combo idea, or even something strange
you noticed about the storyline, then format your email like this:

To: coleman@acavax.lynchburg.edu  <------ Notice this says acavax, not hopwood!
From: (self explanatory!)
Subject: The subject of your post
Body of message:

your posting

Just as simple.  Remember, if you don't send the right thing to the right
address, it might not end up working.  Do _NOT_ send subscription requests to
coleman@acavax.lynchburg.edu.  They will be ignored by the mail software.


* Mortal Kombat Three One-Page FAQ *

If you have access to MS Word for Windows (v2.0 and up) or WordPerfect for
Windows (v6.0 and up) then there is a one page FAQ available containing all
special moves, finishing moves, etc.  To get this moves list, contact John
Coleman at coleman@hopwood.lynchburg.edu for more information.


* Other FAQs *

There are, at the moment, several other FAQs on the net.  You should contact the
individual writers about receiving them.  Here are the names and e-mail
addresses of those I know of:

John George .................................................... floyd@ripco.com
Patrick McCarron ..................................... 75611.3614@compuserve.com
Matt Kruse (Graphical FAQ - Nice stuff!) ................. mkruse@saunix.sau.edu
Kevin Miller ............................................ miller@zeus.towson.edu


Thanks for being patient!
