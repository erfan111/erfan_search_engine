JACKY vs. CPU - Guide, v1.01
=========================================================================
By LHS (larshs@vnet.ibm.com)

This guide was made on request by Pete Stromberg (pez@eo.se), using his
"PAI vs. CPU" guide setup.

*************************************************************************
*** General Information:

When reading this guide, you must bear in mind that it is optimised for
speed. Which means that is not necessary the most fun way to play Jacky,
and the methods of beating the CPU characters will properly not work
with a human opponent. At the end I will make a little section about
Jacky vs. Human techniques.

*************************************************************************
*** Moves ratings:

This is the moves listed in order of importance (IMHO):

1. Elbow & Heel Kick           -  F+P,K   (This is "THE MOVE" - Use it |)
2. Running Punches & Heel Kick -  Hold F,P,P,P,K
3. Side Kick                   -  D,DEF+K
4. Punt Kick                   -  F,F+K
5. Roundhouse & Heel Kick      -  K,K
6. Kickflip                    -  Tap B/U+K
7. Single Punch & Sweep        -  P,D+K
8. Low Backfist (Sweep)        -  Tap D/B+P,D,K
9. Brainbuster                 -  P+DEF

When all the above moves are mastered, you should be able to give the
CPU a serious headache. And following this guide, you should be able
to easily get scores below 3 min. (2/3). I can consistently get times
between 2.00 and 2.15 using this technique, my personal best being
1.46.58 (2/3).

*************************************************************************
*** General Jacky "Pouncing" technique:

"Light Pounce" - Tap U+P
"High Pounce"  - Hold U+P

vs. Jacky  - Always go for the pounce
vs. Jeffry - Always go for the pounce
vs. Sarah  - Always go for the pounce
vs. Kage   - Always go for the pounce
vs. Pai    - Always go for the pounce
vs. Wolf   - Only go for the "Light Pounce", but expect to miss.
vs. Lau    - Only go for the "High Pounce" after the "Roll back trick" |
             (see "Jacky vs. Lau" section), at all other time you should
             only go for the "Light Pounce", if at all.
vs. Akira  - Only go for the as instructed in "Jacky vs. Akira" section.
vs. Dural  - Always go for "Light Pounce"

*************************************************************************
*** From Jacky to Dural:
(In parentheses; the order of difficulty, 1-8, again IMHO.)

Jacky (1)
^^^^^^^^^
Start the round with the "Running Punches & Heel Kick" combo,
then pounce. If the pounce connects then;
  - If he gets up by rolling backwards, you launch another "Running
    Punches & Heel Kick" combo, just before he get up, which will send
    him flying out of the ring.
  - If he rolls to the side, then wait for him to get up, and floor him
    with a ""Elbow & Heel Kick" or a "Punt Kick", and then pounce.
  - If he should catch you with a sweep when getting up, then roll back
    and use the "Running Punches & Heel Kick" combo again.
if not then:
  - Hold defence while he makes his move, and the counter attack with
    "Elbow & Heel Kick" then pounce.

Moves to use if every technique fails:
 - Elbow & Heel Kick
 - Running Punches & Heel Kick
 - Side Kick
 - Punt Kick
 - Roundhouse & Heel Kick
 - Brainbuster

Jeffry (2)
^^^^^^^^^^
You can use the exactly same technique as with Jacky, only difference is
that if the pounce hits, he will almost always roll backwards.

You could also start the round with a "Roundhouse & Hell Kick", which
will usually connect, still it is not a certain hit as the "Running
Punches & Heel Kick" combo is.

Moves to use if every technique fails:
 - Punt Kick
 - Running Punches & Heel Kick
 - Elbow & Heel Kick
 - Roundhouse & Heel Kick

Sarah (3)
^^^^^^^^^
Here you can again use the same technique as with Jacky. Should this
technique fail, use the "Punt Kick" then pounce for the KO. It seems
that Sarah don't know how at defend this, so she will keep on running
into that particular move.

Moves to use if every technique fails (in order of importance):
 - Punt Kick
 - Running Punches & Heel Kick
 - Elbow & Heel Kick

Kage (6)
^^^^^^^^
This is the first opponent, that should pose some trouble. A good start,
is as always, the "Running Punches & Heel Kick" combo, but don't get
surprised if it doesn't connect, if usually don't. Kage normally follows
this combo with his "Heel Kick", if he does then:
 - Go for yet another "Running Punches & Heel Kick" combo, and Kage
   will properly go for the "Heel Kick" again, repeat this for an easy
   Ring Out. (If you wait for a split second, before using the combo
   for the second time, you should be able to actually HIT Kage, then
   follow with the pounce, and then another combo for RO.)

Note: If Kage should knock you down and try his "Head Pounce", quickly
      roll away and go for your own pounce immediately before he hits
      the ground, this should work almost every time.

Moves to use if every technique fails (in order of importance):
 - Elbow & Heel Kick
 - Running Punches & Heel Kick
 - Side Kick
 - Punt Kick
 - Roundhouse & Heel Kick

Pai (4)
^^^^^^^
There are at least two different ways to safely beat-up Pai.

 Waiting for a break - This is actually very simple. Keep some distance
                       between you and Pai, about the distance of her
                       P,P,P,K combo |. If you stand and hold defence she
                       will ALWAYS come blazing at you with her P,P,P,K
                       combo, duck after the first couple of punches,
                       when she kicks over your head throw her. This
                       work every time, with every character against Pai.

 Going for speed - This is the fastest way, but definitely NOT pretty.
                   Start the round the "Running Punches & Heel Kick"
                   combo or an "Elbow & Heel Kick", if either of these
                   hits, go for the pounce. If not use the "Side Kick"
                   over and over again, until KO. It's ugly, but it
                   works.

Moves to use if every technique fails (in order of importance):
 - Side Kick
 - Brainbuster
 - Punt Kick
 - Elbow & Heel Kick
 - Roundhouse & Heel Kick

Wolf (7)
^^^^^^^^
Start with the "Running Punches & Heel Kick" combo, then wait (while
holding defence) for Wolf to stop his series of attack (usually 3
punches), then repeat this technique until RO or KO. Don't expect to hit
every time using this method, but you should be able to make a RO.
Wolf like to make two High Kicks in a row, so when you see him make the
first kick, then when the second kick comes out, go for the "Punt Kick",
he should be wide open.

Moves to use if every technique fails (in order of importance):
 - Running Punches & Heel Kick
 - Side Kick
 - Elbow & Heel Kick
 - Punt Kick

Lau (9)
^^^^^^^
This is the most difficult character to beat, since there is not a
bulletproof technique that works EVERY time. You really just have to
instinctively use the best counterattack for whatever Lau throws at you.
Sounds easy |? right |? Well, this works for me...

1. Start with a "Running Punches & Heel Kick" combo to push him back.
   (If this hits, then "light pounce". If the pounce connects, then he
   will usually roll back, then use another "RP&HK" combo while he gets
   up to push him further back, and finish with a "Side Kick" for a RO or
   KO.)

2. When Lau starts his attack, use the "Side Kick" to stop the attack
   and keep him at a distance. Then use the "Elbow & Heel Kick" or "Punt
   Kick" if he doesn't start his next attack right away. If he on the
   other hand come running back, then use this "Side Kick" technique
   again.
   (You can actually beat him using only the "Side Kick" (D,DEF+K). This
   is THE MOVE to use if everything else fails, against every character.)

Other hints:

 - Use the "Side Kick" and the "Punt Kick" a lot. Especially the "Side
   Kick".

 - You can also use the "Wait, Duck and Throw" technique described under
   Pai, but you have to be careful not to release defence before the
   kick, since he half the time finish with a low kick, unlike Pai.

 - Should he knock you down, then ALWAYS roll back || Because he often
   goes for his pounce, and this leaves him open for a "Roundhouse & Heel
   Kick" followed by a "High Pounce". The double kicks alone take some
   50% and the pounce should take another 25%.
   (This is earlier referred to as the "Roll back trick")

Moves to use if every technique fails (in order of importance):
 - Side Kick
 - Punt Kick
 - Elbow & Heel Kick
 - Roundhouse & Heel Kick
 - Running Punches & Heel Kick
 - Brainbuster

Akira (5)
^^^^^^^^^
Start with the "Running Punches & Heel Kick" combo then defence, this
will NOT connect, then wait for Akira to make his move, then go another
"Running Punches & Heel Kick" combo, this however should knock him down,
then quickly go for a "Light Pounce". If the pounce connects, then Akira
will get up rolling back, and you give another "Running Punches & Heel
Kick" combo for a RO. If the pounce do not connect, then repeatedly use
the "Running Punches & Heel Kick" combo for a RO or KO.

Moves to use if every technique fails (in order of importance):
 - Running Punches & Heel Kick
 - Elbow & Heel Kick
 - Side Kick
 - Kickflip

Dural (8)
^^^^^^^^^
There is no certain method of taking care of Dural, so just try different
techniques, and see how it goes.

Some pointers:

 - Try a "Kickflip" quickly followed by an "Elbow & Heel Kick", this
   will work if Dural doesn't hit you in the air while doing the
   "Kickflip".

 - Don't hesitate to punish her when she misses her pounce.

Moves to use if every technique fails (in order of importance):
 - Punt Kick
 - Elbow & Heel Kick
 - Side Kick
 - Running Punches & Heel Kick
 - "Overhead dashing elbow-hammer" (TAP U+P)
