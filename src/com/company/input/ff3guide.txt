              casts the same spell.  If they use an item, Gogo uses that 
              item too.  He'll even dance if Mog dances before him.
	      Gogo can also do ANY of the other character's attacks by going
	      to the status screen and filling the empty slots under "Mimic".
	      (Move the pointer down to an empty slot and press A).

   This walkthru is exactly that, a walkthru.  It takes the player through 
   every location in the game, in the best order to go through them.  The 
   numbers before each location corresponds to the numbers on the maps that
   come with the game.
			  - The World of Balance -
(1) Mines of Narshe
    Party: Vicks, Wedge, ????? (Terra)
    BOSS: Whelk
	After fighting Whelk you come to the frozen Esper.  You'll go into
	a fight sequence where Vicks and Wedge get blown away leaving Terra.

(1) Arvis' House
    Items: Search the clock for an Elixir
	Terra wakes up back in Narshe where a man removes the slave crown.
	Terra can't remember anything.  The Imperial guards come and Terra
	is forced to escape thru the back door of the house and run back to
	the mines.

(1) Mines
    Party: Terra, Locke
    Chests: Fenix Down, Sleeping Bag
    BOSS: Marshal
    Additional items: You can take Mog's Mithril Shld and Mithril Pike
	After entering the mines, Terra walks a little ways and is spotted
	by the guards.  She is cornered and the the floor gives out and she
	falls.  There is a flashback where Terra remembers some stuff.  The
	scene shifts back to Arvis' House where Locke is introduced.  Locke
	finds Terra and the guards find them both.  Moogles come and offer
	to help.  Three Moogles (Kupek, Kupop, Kumama) form a group with	
	Locke plus there are two other groups with four Moogles each (Mog,
	Kuku, Kutan, Kupan and Kushu, Kurin, Kuru, Kamog).  You can control
	each of the groups, the object is to stop the guards from reaching
	Terra and defeating the commander.  Before defeating the commander
	switch to the party Mog is in and remove his shield and pike (Locke
	can use the shield and the pike can be used by Edgar who you'll get
	shortly), after all Mog won't be needing them for quite a while and 
	by then you'll be able to equip him with other stuff.  After defeating
	the commander, Locke grabs Terra and takes off through the mines.  He 
	comes to a switch and pulls it, opening a secret passage.  Remember 
	where this passage is, you'll need it later.  You are now outside 
	Narshe.  You can't enter the main part of town but you can enter the 
	classroom.

(1) Classroom
    Party: Terra, Locke
    Points of interest: A bucket of recovery water (recovers hps and mps)
                        A save spot
    Chests: Monster-in-a-box, Sleeping Bag, Tonic
    Items: Search a pot for Tincture
	Besides getting the stuff in the chests and the pot, the classroom

    Party: Terra, Locke, Edgar
    Points of interest: Item shop, Tool Shop
    Chests: Fenix Down, Soft, Tonic, Antidote

	Figaro.  Upon entering the castle go straight ahead to the throne
	room.  Here Edgar is introduced.  You are now free to explore the
	castle.  If you talk to the Matron (in the left tower) she will tell
	you about Sabin, who you'll meet later.  After talking the Matron
	return to the throne room and talk to Edgar again.  One of Edgar's
	guards comes in and informs him that Kefka is approaching the castle.  
	As Edgar, talk to Kefka's guards and then Kefka himself.  After they're 
	done talking walk up to where Locke is waiting.  Edgar decides to
	protect Terra.  Now, as Terra, follow Locke to 'your' room.  Kefka
	comes back and sets fire to Figaro.  Talk to the guards (Beavis and 
	Butthead ?) and then talk to Kefka.  Go up and talk to the guard there.
  	Your party escapes and Figaro enters submerge mode.  After fighting 
	the M-TekArmor, go south to the Cave of Figaro.

    Chests: 2 tinctures, Fenix Down (Before you get Celes)

	Wait until after you get Celes to get the treasures for different stuff.

    Items: search barrel to left of Chocobo stable for Tonic
	   search barrel to right of rich guy's house for Fenix Down

	   search box in lower left section of town for Eyedrop
			(or Elixir if you wait until World of Ruin)
	   search barrel in lower left section of town for Antidote
			(or Tent if you wait until World of Ruin)
	   search box in lower left section of town for Soft
			(or Remedy if you wait until World of Ruin)
	   search barrel between Armor & Weapon shops for Tonic
			(or X-Potion if you wait until World of Ruin)
	At the Cafe, Shadow is introduced, you'll be seeing him later.  At
	the Relic Shop, buy a pair of Sprint Shoes (unless you like going 
	slow), one pair is enough for the entire party.  Check behind the
	Chocobo stables for a Green Cherry.  At the house north
	of the Inn check behind the bookcase in the room with a draft to find
	a secret passage.  Nothing but money down there right now but later
	you'll need to know about it.  After getting equipped go to the 
	Chocobo Stables and pay the 80 GP (unless you want to fight to your
	next location).  It's not very far but riding the Chocobo is fun :)

(5) Sabin's Cabin
    Items: search the bucket next to the stove for a Tonic
    Points of interest: you can catch some Z's in any of the beds

(6) Mt. Kolts
    Chests: Guardian,Atlas Armlet,2 Tents
    BOSS: Vargas
	The path is straight forward.  At the end you reach Vargas.  After
	a bit of fighting with Vargas, Sabin will come.  Vargas will blow the
	others away and Sabin will have to fight alone.  Sabin joins you after
	Vargas is finished.

(7) Returner's Hideout
    Party: Terra, Locke, Edgar, Sabin
    Chests: Fenix Down, Air Lancet, True Knight, Potion, White Cape
    Items: search a bucket for Antidote
           search a pot for Tincture
	   search a pot for Green Cherry
	   search the top of the table for a piece of paper (purpose ?)
    Additional items: You can either get a Genji Glove or a Gauntlet
	After entering, follow the guard to Banon's room.  After talking to
	Banon talk to everyone and get everything (including the White Cape
	that is in a secret passage on the right side of the 'storage room'),
	then go out of the hideout where Banon will be waiting. First, tell him 
	"no" then go back inside and the man in the 'storage room' will give
	you a Genji Glove.  If you say "no" to Banon 3 times and you'll skip 
	the part where everyone's at the table and one of the guards will give 
	you a Genji Glove (if you didn't already get the one from the guy
	in the store room).  If you go to Banon and tell him you will become
	there last ray of hope he will give you Gauntlet (if you haven't already
	gotten the Genji Glove from the guy in the store room). Locke will split
	to scope out South Figaro after the Empire invades.  Banon joins you
	and you head for the raft on the Lete River.

    Lete River
    BOSS: Ultros
	If Banon dies the game is over, so protect him.  There are several
	save spots along the way, these spots are also the only places you
	can access the subscreen.  Do whatever you need to before jumping
	back on the raft.  Toward the end of the raft ride you reach Ultros
	the octopus.  After the fight, Sabin jumps in after Ultros and is
	swept down river. 

    The game now gives you a choice of three scenerios.  One with Terra, Edgar
    and Banon, one with Locke, and the last one with Sabin.  You can do these
    in any order you want, it doesn't matter what order you pick.  However,
    if you do Terra, Edgar, and Banon's before Sabin's then Shadow will stay
    longer.
			--TERRA, EDGAR, and BANON scenerio--
    Lete River continued
    Party: Terra, Edgar, Banon
	The trio continue the raft ride on the Lete River.  Again, make sure
	Banin doesn't kick the bucket or you games over.  At the end of the
	ride you find yourself a little east of Narshe, which is where you
	want to go.

(1) Narshe/Mines
    Chest: Rune Edge [in mines] (if you don't get this chest until the World
			of Ruin it'll become a Ribbon)
	The guards won't let you in thru the main entrance so you'll have to
	find another way in.  Remember the secret entrance Locke showed you?
	That's the way in.  You're now in the mines.  Go a little ways and 
	you come to a follow-the-light-maze.  If you make a mistake all you
	need to do is press the A button when the yellow light is in front
	of you.  If you miss it you'll have to fight some enemies and 
	then you'll have to start at the beginning of the maze again.
	The correct way thru is:
                               E---|                  * = rocks
                               *   |   *              S = Start
                             |---| |------|           E = Exit
                           * | * |     *  |       | & - = Correct path
                         |---|   |        |
                         | *   * |     *  |
                         |-----S |--------|
	Once you get past this maze you can reach a cave of Moogles (and a
	chest containing a Rune Edge or Ribbon if you wait) by going slightly 
	out of your way. Remember where this cave is because later in the game 
	Mog will join you here).  Once you get out of the mines you will be back
	in Arvis' House where you started.  You will talk a bit with
	Arvis and then the scenerio will end.
			--LOCKE's scenerio--
(4) South Figaro
    Party: Locke
    Chest: Hyperwrist, RunningShoes
    Items: Check the clock you see when you first come out of the secret 
			passage for an Elixir
	   Check a pail in the old man-who-wants-cider's house for Tonic
    Additional items: Cider is located here (Rare item)
		      Old Clock-Key is located here (Rare item)
	First of all, DO NOT talk the guards in MagiTek armor (unless of
	course you have a death wish :)  Oh, and don't forget to equip your
	stuff.  Go to the Item shop and talk to the merchant next to the clock.
	This will start a fight.  Use Locke's Steal command and you'll steal
	the clothes right off him.  Dressed as a merchant, enter the house
	to the south of the Item Shop and go down stairs.  The kid will only
	allow you to pass if your dresses as a merchant.  Now go up onto the
	perimeter wall and talk to the green suited guard.  Steal his clothes.
	Go towards the center of town where you'll find three guards (one
	guarding the door to the rich guy's house, one in MagiTek armor, and
	one guarding the path to the rest of the town).  Talk to the bottom
	guards.  Enter the Cafe and go downstairs.  Steal the merchant's 
	clothes. You'll also get Cider.  Go back to the house with the kid
	and go upstairs.  Talk to the old man at the desk.  Go back down
	stairs and give the password ("Courage") to the kid.  He'll open up
	a secret passage for you.  Go to the upstairs of the house and into
	the first room.  Walk behind the bookcase to find a stairway.  Go all
	the way down and follow the hall.  After you are asked about changing
	clothes (doesn't matter if you do), go straight down into the
	wall (there is a stairway there):
		----------------|                    | & - = wall
                --------------| |                        / = door
                |-------------| |--/--/--/-|             ^ = walk into the
                |                          |                 wall here to
                |--------------------------|                 find a room
                               ^                             with a Hyper-
                                                             wrist and Running
							     Shoes
	If you are wearing the merchant's clothes or your normal clothes you'll
	hide in the rafters.  If you're wearing the soldier's uniform you
	stand next to the door and salute, and then when you rescue Celes she
	says something close to what Princess Liea said in Star Wars when
	Luke rescued her on the Death Star (replace soldier with Stormtrooper).
	After dropping from the rafters, enter the open door.  Remove Celes'
	chains.  Talk to the sleeping guard and take the clock key.  The 
	second door is a save spot and the third is where you want to go.
	Go to the clock in the far back and check it.  Wind the clock to 
	open a secret passage.

(4) Secret Passage
    Party: Locke, Celes
    Chests: Iron Armour, Heavy Shld, RegalCutlass, X-Potion, Ribbon, 
		Ether, Earrings
    BOSS: TunnlArmr
	In the secret passage there is a spot that you can push on the left
	wall to reach a stairway leading down to a X-Potion, a Ribbon, and
	and Ether.  Once you make it out of the secret passage you'll be in a 
	spot where all you need to do is leave the town.  Go west to the Cave
	of Figaro.  You've been here before, just go back out the way you came 
	in.  Don't forget the pond with the turtle is a recovery spring.  As
	you are about to exit the cave TunnelArmr attacks.  Defeating TunnelArmr
	will end this scenerio.

			--SABIN's scenerio--
    Hut (Gau's father's house)
    Party: Sabin, Shadow
	Enter the hut just east of where you start.  Quickly talk to the guy
	on the Chocobo.  He sells lots of stuff.  Next talk to Shadow and 
	he'll join you.  Go east a bit then south until you come to a bridge.
	This is the Imperial camp.

(9) Imperial Camp
    Party: Sabin, Shadow
	Your group hides and overhears the plans to storm Doma Castle.

(10)Doma Castle
    Party: Cyan
    BOSS: Leader
	You can kill the soldiers on either side of the leader pretty easily
	but just kill the leader and get it over with.

(9) Imperial Camp
    Party: Sabin, Shadow
    Chest: Star Pendant, Monster-in-a-box(Telstar), MithrilGlove,BarrierRing
	In the left tent there is a chest.  Kicking it brings the dogs, which
	you have to fight, and hitting it brings a sentry which you fool by
	meowing.  Inside is a Star Pendant.  There's a little bit of story
	about Kefka poisoning Doma and you decide to try and stop him.  After 
	the first time you chase him, instead of talking to him, explore the 
	camp for more treasures.  You fight and chase him around for a bit but 
	are stopped by some soldiers.  While fighting them, Kefka poisons Doma.
 	After showing a bunch of soldiers die of poison in Doma Castle you 
	control Cyan.  Go to the throne room.  After the King dies go to the 
	room east of the throne room.  Cyan's family dies.  Scene cuts back to 
	the Imperial Camp where Cyan joins Sabin and Shadow.  Escape the camp. 
	After leaving the camp go south to the forest.

(11) Phantom Forest
     Party: Sabin, Shadow, Cyan
     Points of interest: after the first stretch of forest you go up, the pond
				right in front of you is a recovery spring.
	At the end of the forest you'll come to the Phantom Train.  If you
	haven't done Terra, Edgar, and Banon's scenerio yet, then Shadow
	will leave you somewhere in the Forest.

(11) Phantom Train
     Chests: Earrings, Monster-in-a-box(Specter), 2 Fenix Downs, Sniper Sight
     BOSS: Ghost Train
	Caboose: Upon enter the train go right to find the caboose.  Talk to
		 the ghost and you can have him join you (if you use its
		 POSSESS command, and it works, you'll lose it).  Also in the
		 caboose is a guy who'll tell you about the train, and a save
		 spot.
	Car 1 & 2: In the first two cars there are a bunch of ghosts. These
		   ghosts will either try to join you, attack you, or sell
		   you stuff (Item Shop).  The rest of the ghosts in the 
		   train will do the same things.
	Car 3: Upon entering a ghost comes and blocks the door behind you.
	       You have to kill the ghost to leave.  Once back out, climb
	       to the top of the car and you'll jump across to the next car
	       and then again to car 5.
	Car 5: Enter the car and pull the switch to detach the rear cars.
	       Pull it again to open the wall up so you can continue.
	Car 6: Sit at the center table and the ghost will serve you (this
	       replenishes your stats).  After sitting down the first time
	       sit down again with different members at the head of your 
	       party to see different sequences (For instance, Shadow will
	       get up and feed Interceptor).
	Car 7: 1st room: Siegfried attacks as you approach the chest.  After
			 defeating him, he grabs the contents of the chest
		 	 and runs.
	Car 8: 2nd room: four chests.
	After car 8 your ghost companion leaves.
	Car 9: save spot
	Engine: Pull the 1st and 3rd switches on the inside then go out and
		pull the switch on the smoke stack.  The Ghost Train now
		attacks.  After showing the people of Doma enter the train
		you are on the other side of the Phantom Forest.  Go to the
		mountain pass to the east.

(12)Barren Falls
	Here Shadow leaves the party (if he hasn't already).  Jump off the
	edge of the cliff.  You have to fight Piranha and a Rizopas as you
	fall.

(13)The Veldt
    Party: Sabin, Cyan
        After landing you awake to find Gau stading next to you.  He runs when
	you speak to him.  Until you have Dried Meat just attack Gau if you
	meet him.  Go east to the town of Mobliz.

(14)Mobliz
    Items: search the clock in the messenger's house for Elixir
    Additional items: You can get a Tintinabar here
	Buy at least one Dried Meat at the item shop.  Talk to the injured
	lad from Maranda.  After talking to him you can send a message to his
	girlfriend at the messenger's house.  It costs 500 GP.  You can sleep
	in the bed at the back of the Relic Shop so no need to spend money
	at the Inn.  After talking to the Relic Shop keeper go back to the
	injured lad, another letter has arrived.  For another 500 GP you can 
	send a record for the injured lad.  Talk to the Relic Shop keeper 
	again, return to the lad for another letter, send a Tonic for another 
	500 GP, talk to the Relic Shop keeper, etc.  Keep doing this and
	eventually the injured lad will reward you with a Tintinabar for all
	your help.  Now leave town and go find Gau.

(13)The Veldt
	When you see Gau use Dried Meat on him and he'll join you.  Once you
	have Gau and have advance his Rage skills as much as you want, go to
	the cave in Cresent Mountain.

(15)Cresent Mountain
    Party: Sabin, Cyan, Gau
    Additional items: Exploring the cave Gau will find a Tonic for you
	By taking Gau around inside the cave he'll find stuff.  On the little
	platform to the left of the entrance he'll find Tonic.  On the 
	platform at the top left part of the cave Gau will pretend to have
	found something. Sabin will walk over and Gau will scare him, causing
	him to lose his pouch with 500 GP in it.  Finally at the end of the
	cave he'll find his treasure, a diving suit helmet.  After you jump
	in you'll be in the "Serpent's Trench."

    Serpent's Trench
    Chests: X-Potion, Green Baret
	There are spots in the trench where you can pick a direction.  The
	following table shows what directions do what:
                           START             
                        /          \
		LEFT                   RIGHT
               /    \                    |
            LEFT   RIGHT               CAVE 1
             |       |                /      \  
            OUT    CAVE 2          LEFT     RIGHT
                     |              |         |
                    OUT            OUT      CAVE 2
                                              |
                                             OUT
	As you can see taking two lefts is the fastest way out but taking two
	rights will get you all the treasure.  Anyway you go you come out
	of the trench at Nikeah.

(16)Nikeah
    Items: check the clock in the Inn for Elixir
	Besides the Elixir in the Inn, there really isn't much here.  Go back
	to the guy on the boat and hop aboard.  End of Scenerio.

(1) Hills of Narshe
    Party: Terra, Locke, Edgar, Sabin, Gau, Celes, Cyan
    BOSS: Kefka
	You'll fight in 3 groups.  You have to defeat Kefka before his troops
	reach Banon.  Your best bet is probably to take out all the soldiers
	then you can keep trying Kefka until you beat him.  Or you can make
	a party of four characters (with 2 and 1 in the other ones) and go
	straight for Kefka.  If done right you can dodge all the soldiers and
	get to Kefka before they are even halfway to Banon.  After the fight
	Terra will morph because of the Esper and fly away.
			--IN SEARCH OF TERRA--
(1) Narshe
    Party: Pick four (3 if you want Shadow to join you a bit later) out of
		Locke, Cyan, Edgar, Sabin, Celes, or Gau
    Items: Check the clock in the Elder's house for Elixir
    Chests: Wall Ring, Sneak Ring, Hyperwrist, ThiefKnife, Earrings, 5000 GP
	You can sleep in the bed in the back room of the Weapon Shop.  If
	you go north to the mines and look at the little black hole to the
	upper right of the entrance you'll see Umaro the sasquatch (he'll
	join you later). Upon exiting fo to Figaro (its in the same spot it
	was before).

(2) Figaro
	Enter the castle and go down the stairs to you left.  Talk to the guy
	and he'll take you (and the rest of Figaro Castle) past the mountains
	to a point near Kohlingen (your next destination). Just exit Figaro
	and go north.  If you have both Edgar and Sabin in your party you'll
	learn more about their past if you go to the spot where you can sleep.
	If you enter the main part of Figaro and shop put Edgar at the head of
	your party and the shopkeepers will give you a 50% discount.

(17)Kohlingen
    Chests: Green Beret
    Items: Check the clock in Rachel's house for Elixir
	Shadow is in the Cafe.  If you have less than 4 in you party he'll
	join you for 3000 GP.  If you have 4 and you want him to join you
	go back to Figaro and have the guy in the basement return Figaro back
	to where it was.  Then go back to Narshe and talk to one of your 
	companions.  Change your party so it only has three members.  Now
	come back to Kohlingen the way you did before.  If you have Locke and
	go to the house in the top left corner you'll see a flashback telling
	why Locke is so keen on keeping his word about protecting Terra and
	Celes.  The house on the top right will also show a flashback if you
	have Locke and if you go behind the house and push down you'll find
	a back entrance to this house which leads to a chest.  From 
	Kohlingen go south to Jidoor or you can go northwest to a hut where 
	you'll find a Hero Ring in a pot then go south to Jidoor.

(18)Jidoor
    Items: in the very top house check a pot for Tincture
	From here head north (on the right side of the mountains) to Zozo.
	Take a Chocobo for a faster trip.  Just follow the light green strip
	of grass.

(19)Zozo
    Chests: Tincture, Chain Saw, Tonic, ThiefGlove, FireKnuckle, RunningShoes, 
   		X-Potion
    Items: check a pot in the far left building for Tincture and another pot
		for Potion
    BOSS: Dadaluma
    Espers: Ramuh, Stray, Siren, Kirin
	In the builind marked Inn there is a clock you are supposed to reset.
	The correct time is 6:10:50.  Setting the clock open a secret passage
	where a chest containing a Chain Saw is.  The builing marked as
	Armor Shop has a chest with a Tonic.  Go to the builind marked as the
	Relic Shop.  Go up as far as you can and you'll find a chest with the
	ThiefGlove.  From there go back down to the floor with the doorless
	doorway (just below the guy jumping from window to window).  Push
	over against the window and you'll jump across.  Keep going up, jumping
	from building to building where need be, and evetually you'll reach
	Terra.  Before you reach Terra you'll have to near Dadaluma.  After
	reaching Terra you'll get 4 Espers: Ramuh, Stray, Siren, and Kirin.
	There are also two chests on each side of this room.  Once your done
	go down and talk to one of your other three companions that just 
	arrived.  Everyone goes back down the building and you find yourself
	back at the entrance of Zozo where your party will break up into two
	groups: one consists of Celes, Locke, and two others of your choice.
	Shadow splits again so you can't choose him.  This group is the one
	you'll control to get to your next destination.  The other two
	companions will return to Narshe.  Next stop: Jidoor again.

(18)Jidoor
	Go to the big house at the far north of town.  Here you'll find the
	director of the Opera.  As he leaves he drops a letter.  Read it and
	you find out about Setzer, the wandering gambler who owns an airship
	(which you nee).  From Jidoor go south to the Opera House (taking a
	Chocobo makes the trip much faster).

(20)Opera House
    BOSS: Ultros
	Celes looks like the opera singer Maria, so she takes her place in
	order to get to Setzer.  As Celes you have to sing the right parts
	of the song (the full song is printed in the book of Celes' dressing
	room).  The correct parts are:
			Oh, my hero...
			I'm the darkness...
			Must I...
	If you sing the wrong part you'll get kicked out of the opera house.
	Re-enter and the director will let you try again.  You only get four
	tries to get it right before it's game over.  Once you get it right,
	keep talking to the guy who comes out.  Then when he disappears grab
	the flowers then go up to th platform on the top floor.  If you take
	too much time doing any of this you'll get kicked out again and will
	have to start over from the beginning of the singing part again. 
	Take Locke and read the letter in the dressing room.  Now return to
	the balcony and talk to Impressario.  Once Ultros shows himself on
	the girders with a 4 ton weight poised over Celes' head, you'll have
	5 minutes to get to him. First you have to go northeast where you'll
 	find a guy who tells you to pull the far right switch, do this then
	return to Impressario and go to the northwest side of the balcony 
	where you'll find your way onto the girders.  Navigate the girders
	and make it to Ultros.  When you're done Setzer will come and grab
	Celes.  After some convincing (with a nice double-headed coin)
	Setzer will take you to your next destination in his airship.
	(For more about the airship, see ON THE AIRSHIP).

(21)Albrook
    Items: Search the clock in the Cafe for Elixir
	   Pot in weapon shop has Tincture
	   Search barrel next to the Inn for Potion
	   Search box on right side of docks for Warp Stone
	From Albrook head north past Vector and on up to the town of Tzen.
	(Going to Tzen and Maranda is not mandatory, you can go directly to
	Vector).

(22)Tzen
	Nothing here but some info and some decent weapons and armor.  From
	here go southweat to Maranda.

(23)Maranda
    Items: Search box to left of entrance of town for Revivify
	   Search box on right side of town for Remedy
	The house in the top right corner is the house of the girl you were
	sending stuff to for that injured lad.  Next stop Vector.

(24)Vector
 	The Inn says it free but sometimes when you're sleeping the keeper
	will steal 1000 GP.  In the skinny house there is an old woman asking
	if you pledge alligence to the Empire.  Answer "no" and two guards
	attack you. When you beat them and talk to the woman again she'll
	heal you.  Don't talk to any of the guards or you'll be attacked and
	sent back to the entrance.  If you go north to the Imperial Castle
	you'll get attacked by Guardian.  Run from it.  To the right of
	the Inn there is a guy hiding behind a box.  Talk to him.  Notice
	where he moves to.  When he distracts the guards go to that spot and
	push on the box.  Now go north and you'll be at the MagiTek Factory.

(24)MagiTek Factory 
    Chests: Flame Sabre, Tincture, X-Potion, ThunderBlade, Remedy, Zephyr Cape,
	      DragoonBoots, Tent, Gold Helmet,Gold Shld,Gold Armor, Break Blade
    BOSS: Ifrit, Shiva, Number 024, Number 128, Cranes
    Espers: Ifrit, Shiva, Unicorn, Maduin, Shoat, Phantom Carbunkl, Bismark
	Go down the stairs and go to where the little hook is moving back and
	forth.  Push A to jump onto it.  Get the chest and the jump back 
	across.  Now go right and enter the second little pipe that is to the
	right of the stairs.  Grab the chest then climb back thru the pipe 
	and enter the first pipe.  Grab the treasure and go across the conveyer
	belt for another two treasures.  Now get on the conveyer belt to go
	down a level.  Down here you'll find 5 chests: one on the left side,
	one on the right side, one through a door just to the left of
	where you entered, one at the bottom (you can see it when you go 
	down on from where you entered but you have to go around and underneath
	to get it), and one in a small room to the east of the room with the
	gold helmet in it.  On the right wall there is a spot where you can
	go between two walls to enter a pipe which leads to 2 more chests.
	When you're ready step onto the conveyer belt to the right of where the 
	last belt dropped you off.  You'll see Kefka push a couple of Espers 
	onto a conveyer belt.  When you can move, follow the Espers.  Go over 
	and talk to the Esper on the left.  You'll now have to fight Ifrit and 
	Shiva.  They'll give you their powers as magicite when you defeat them.
        Now, entering the left door you'll find a save spot.  The right 
	door is the way out.  After you go up a bunch of stairs you'll come to 
	a hall with the Esper holding tanks in them.  There is a hidden chest
	in this room.  Go to the far left end of the hall.  Now go down nect
	to the holding tank and search around.  You'll find the Break Blade.
  	After the hall you'll reach the exit with Number 024 blocking it.
	After you beat Number 024 you'll enter a room with Espers floating
	in tanks.  Go to the far north wall and press the switch.  You'll
	get the Espers: Unicorn, Maduin, Shoat, Phantom, Carbunkl, and 
	Bismark.  Kefka comes out and Celes zaps herself, Kefka, and his
	guards away.  Follow Cid. Talk to Cid. Ride the rails.  At the end
	of the mine cart ride you'll have to fight Number 128.  You'll now
	be back in town.  Follow the rails and you'll be back in the main
	part of town where Setzer will come and get you.  As you attempt
	to get away in the airship you'll be attacked by 2 Cranes.  Once
	you defeat the cranes, you'll go back to Zozo automatically.

(19)Zozo
	You'll automatically be in Terra's room.  A magicite will glow and
	Terra will remember.  You now control Maduin, the Esper and Terra's
	father, in the Esper's world.  This part is fairly straightforward.
	After the flashback you'll be in control of the airship.  You can go
	where ever you want now.  Narshe is your next destination.

(1) Narshe
    Points of interest: New stuff in the weapon  and armor shops
	As you enter a guard will appear and take you to Banon.  From here
	go to the house with the locked treasure chest.  You'll find Lone Wolf
	the pickpocket.  He escapes and the chest is empty.  Follow him north
	to the mines.  If you keep following you'll eventually reach him up
	where the Esper in ice is.  He's holding a Moogle hostage.  Just hold
	still for a bit and the Moogle will escape.  Now you have a choice:
	go over and talk to the Moogle and he joins your party and Lone Wolf
	drops over the cliff, OR talk to Lone Wolf and you'll get Gold HairPin
	and the both Lone Wolf and Mog drops over the cliff.  Now return to
	town, do whatever shopping you want and go to the airship.
	
     Getting Mog's Water Rondo Dance
     Espers: Golem, Zoneseek
	There are 3 different ways to get Mog's water rondo.  For all of them
	you need Mog in your party (DUH! :). So, add Mog to your party and...
	METHOD 1: return to Cresent Mountain.  Enter and jump into
		  the "Serpent Trench".  When you get out of the trench you'll
 		  be in Nikeah.  Exit Nikeah (DO NOT GET ON THE SHIP!!) and go
		  north (to make the long trip back to the airship a lot faster
		  grab a Chocobo inside Nikeah).  Keep going and you'll
		  eventually reach the hut where Sabin's scenerio started.
		  From here go back thru where the Imperial Base was, thru the
		  Phantom Forest, jump off at Barren Falls, and finally you're
		  back on the Veldt.  Go get your airship and continue the game.
	METHOD 2: This way is the longest but you can get almost all of Mog's
		  dances doing it this way.  Land your airship at the entrance
		  to the Returner's hideout and jump on the raft on the Lete
		  River.  This time the raft will go the way Sabin went the
		  first time and you'll end up near Gau's father's house.
		  From here you have to go thru Sabin's scenerio and hop on
		  the boat To South Figaro in Nikeah.  Once in South Figaro
		  it's kinda cool:  the captain of the ship smuggles you into
		  town in a treasue chest :)  Now you have to go all the way
		  thru Mt. Kolts again and you'll finally be to the point 
		  where you can retrieve the airship.
	METHOD 3: This was is short and fast.  Land the airship at Nikeah.
		  Take a Chocobo from here and go to Baren Falls.  Jump in
		  and then go to the Serpent's Trench which will take you
		  back to Nikeah where the airship is waiting.
	Once you have Mog's water rondo go to the Imperial Base next to the
	bridge to the east of Vector.  The Auction House in Jidoor is now open
	making it possible to get Golem and Zoneseek now [see THE AUCTION HOUSE
	for more info].

    Imperial Base  
	If you enter without Terra you'll be kicked out.  So if you don't have
	Terra return to the airship and change party members.  In the building
	is a treasure room with a locked door.  Make your way thru to the 
	other side of the base and exit.  Head east and you'll enter the Cave
	to the Sealed Gate.

(25)Cave to the Sealed Gate
    Chests: Assassin, Tempest, Coin Toss, X-Potion, 3 Ethers, Genji Glove,
	    Tent, Elixir, 3 Magicites, Atma Weapon
	In the room after the one with the moving bridges, pull the switch
	on the bridge.  Now follow the left path to reach a chest with Genji
	Glove.  Now go back and take the right path.  Go up and pull the left
	switch.  Enter the doorway that appears, get the chest, and save your
	game.  Pulling the right switch makes you fight Ninja.  Pull the switch
	on the next bridge and go down to the stairway it makes.  Go thru the
	hole after you get the chest.  Step on both switches you can see.
	Go down and then left.  Step on that switch and enter the door that
	appears.  After getting the treasure leave the room and go right to
	the far bridge and then up.  Pull the switch, cross the bridge, and 
	pull another switch.  Go up and left across the brides.  Flick the
	switch inside the chest and return back to your right.  Grab the chest
	up the stairs then go down and exit the room.  Go up the stairs in 
	the next room and your at the Sealed Gate.  Now you have to fight
	Kefka again (kinda).  To get back to the airship all you need to do
	is go down and out, and then go back thru the Imperial Base.  On the
	airship the Espers attack and you lose control of the ship, crashing
	just south of Maranda.  From here go northeast to Vector.

(24)Vector revisited
    Chests: Back Guard, X-Potion, Tincture, Gale Hairpin, Revivify
    Points of interest: if you examine a toilet, you'll jump on it, squat,
			and flush :)
    Additional items: It's possible to get a Tintinabar and Charm Bangle
	Go north to the Imperial Castle (the Guardian isn't here now).  Follow
	the guy who comes out to greet you on the stairs.  Talk to Gestahl.
	He'll invite you to a banquet, but before dinner you have four minutes
	to talk to as many of the 24 soldiers in the castle as you can. The
	more you talk to the better your reward.  Don't waste time getting
	treasures (you can get them later) and don't talk to Kefka (he rambles
	on forever).
	At the banquet:  During the banquet you'll be given choices.  Each
	choice is worth a certain amount of points.  The point system is as
	follows:
		Each guard talked to         : 1 pt each (24 pts total)
		Each guard faught            : 4 pts each (20 pts total)
		Who to toast?
		    To the Empire            : 2 pts
		    To the Returners         : 1 pt
		    To our hometowns         : 5 pts
		About Kefka?

		    Let him go               : 1 pt

		About Doma?
		    What's done is done      : 1 pt
		    That was inexcusable     : 5 pts
		    Apologize again!!        : 3pts
		About Celes?
		    Was she a spy?           : 1 pt
		    Celes is one of us       : 5 pts
		    We trust Celes           : 3 pts
		Any questions?               : 2 pts each
				(-10 pts if a question is asked twice)
		About the Espers?
		    They've gone to far      : 5 pts
		    You unleashed their power: 2 pts
		Which question asked first?  : 5 pts
		Take a break                 : 5 pts
		Anything you'd like me to say?
		    All I want is peace      : 3 pts
		    The war is over          : 5 pts
		    I'm sorry                : 1 pt
		Do me a favor?
		    Say yes the first time   : 3pts
	Towards the middle of the banquet Cid will ask if you want to take a
	break.  If you answer yes you can walk around the room.  The four
	sentries at Gestahl's sides will 'test your strength' if you talk
	to them.  Return to the center seat when you're ready to continue 
	the meal.  Terra and Locke decide to head to Albrook.  Before you go
	remember to go back for all the treasure you saw while talking to
	the soldiers.  As you leave the banquet hall a sentry will approach
	you and reward you for talking the soldiers.  You will now be rewarded
	based on the above point system as follows:
	  0-49 pts: Imperial troops withdraw from South Figaro
	 50-66 pts: Imperial troops withdraw from Doma
	 67-76 pts: The locked door in the house in the Imperial Base will
								 be unlocked.
	 77-89 pts: You get Tintinabar.
	 90-93 pts: You get Charm Bangle.
	When you're done in Vector return to the Imperial Base if you got
	the reward that unlocks the treause room.  If not go to Tzen.

    Imperial Base again
    Chests: Cherub Down, X-Potion, 8000 GP, Ether, Cure Ring, Back Guard,
	    2 Elixirs, RunningShoes, 20000 GP, Wall Ring, 13000 GP
    Items: Check the stove for Flame Sabre
	Go the house and down the stairs.  The door is now unlocked if you 
	got that rewared in Vector.  Grab all the treasure (there is a hidden
	chest in the bottom righthand corner of the room).  Now leave the base
	and go west to Tzen.

(22)Tzen
    Espers: Sraphim
	Talk to the guy hiding in the trees behind the Relic Shop.  He'll sell
	you the Esper Sraphim for 3000 GP.  If you get Sraphim now you'll be
	out 3000 GP but you'll have more time to have it equipped.  If, however,
	you wait until the World of Ruin you can buy it from the same guy for
	a measly 10 GP. 

(21)Albrook
    Party: Locke, Terra
	Go the dock and get on the boat.  Talk to General Leo.  After you're
	thru there, go to the Inn and take a nap.  When you wake up return
	to the ship and talk to Leo and your on your way.

(27)Thamasa
    Party: Locke, Terra, Shadow
    Items: Check the middle barrel by the item shop for Eyedrop
	   Check a barrel by the Relic shop for Soft
	   Check a barrel by the Elder's house for Echo Screen
    	   Check a barrel by Strago's house for Green Cherry
	   Check left wall in the upstairs of Strago's house for Memento Ring
	Once your ship lands, follow the light green path and then go out onto
	the peninsula to get to Thamasa.  Notice the Inn costs a lot 
	(1500 GP !!), after you talk to Strago, it'll only cost 1 GP (cool
	beans :).  After talking to Strago, go to the Inn and take a nap.
	In the middle of the night Strago will come in and wake you up. His
	grand-daughter Relm is in a house that's on fire.  Talk to Stago
	outside the burning house.  He'll join you and you'll have to go
	in to save Relm.

(27)Inside the Burning House
    Party: Locke, Terra, Strago
    Chests: Fire Rod, Ice Rod
    BOSS: FlameEater
	If you touch any of the roaming flames you'll be attacked by Balloons.
	I suugest you equip someone with Shiva.  When you come to a choice
	of two doors pick the right one.  You'll get attacked if you enter
	the left one.  You'll now have a choice of two more doors.  The right
	one has a chest in it.  The left one leads you to two more doors.
	The right one has an Ice Rod, and the left leads upstairs.  Once
	upstairs you'll meet the source of the flames - FlameEater.  After
	you defeat FlameEater you'll find Relm.  After saving you, Shadow
	will split (yet again).  Now, with Strago, go west along the mountains
	and you'll find your next destination - a cave.

(28)Gathering Place of the Espers
    Party: Locke, Terra, Strago
    Chests: Heal Rod, X-Potion, Tabby Suit, Chocobo Suit
    BOSS: Ultros
	In the first room there are 3 exits.  The left one and the top one
	lead to one another so the right one is the correct way to go.  After
	a bit you'll reach three statues, the source of all magic.  As you
	walk away from the statues your pal Ultros attacks.  If you kill Ultros
	with the Vanish/Doom technique Relm will still take credit for helping
	defeat him even though she had nothing to do with it :)  When you get to
	the room with the save spot step onto one of the squares on the floor.
	You'll fall down a level.  The rightmost hole leads to a chest, the
	top left hole lead to another two chests, and the bottom left hole
	leads to the Espers.

(27)Back in Thamasa
    BOSS: Kefka (you fight against him with General Leo)
	This is almost like a fake ending: the Espers and the humans have
	reached an agreement and everyone is happy.... then Kefka shows up.
	You now have control of General Leo.  If you try to leave town you'll
	be attacked by the invincible Guardian.  Go talk to Kefka, you'll have
	to fight him. It doesn't matter how you fight him, you're going to
	win (or so you think).  You now have control of the airship agian.
	If you re-enter Thamasa you'll find Strago's friend Gungho and you'll
	learn more about Hidon (who you can defeat later).  When you're ready 
	enter the airship.  The island with the Sealed Gate on it will break
	off and float up into the sky.  When you're ready go and find the 
	floating continent. Pick a party of 3 and you're on your way.

    On the way to the Floating Island
    BOSS: Ultros, Chupon, Air Force
	Before reaching the Floating Island you'll have to fight a whole
	bunch of Sky Armors and Spit Fires, and then when you're almost there
	you get to fight you good buddy Ultros, but this time he's brought
	his friend Chupon.  After Chupon sneezes you away (if you kill Ultros
	before Chupon appears using the Vanish/Doom trick Chupon won't show 
	up and instead of being sneezed off you'll just kinda jump off :), 
	you'll fall off the airship and have to fight Air Force.  After 
	defeating it you'll land on the Floating Island.

    Floating Island
    Chests (Blue orbs): Murasame, Monster-in-a-box(Gigantos), Beret, Elixir
    Additonal items: Gigantos gives you Hardened
    BOSS: AtmaWeapon, Nerapa
	You'll land near a save spot.  And just a little below that you'll
	see Shadow.  He'll join you when you talk to him.  Go right and you'll
	come to a stairway leading to a seemingly solid wall. Just press up
	against the wall and it'll open up.  When you come to a blue orb,
	examine it and you'll get Murasame.  Go as far as you can to the right
	and push down along the wall until you find a path leading to another
	blue orb.  This one has a monster-in-a-box, namely Gigantos.  When
	you beat it you get Hardened.  Now go back to your left a little until
	you see a indentation on the upper wall.  Press you here and a passage
	will open up.  Go up and step into the center of the square.  When
	you reappear go down as far as you can and then press up into the 
	indentation on your right.  Now go right and down and right again.
	Follow this path and enter the transporter.  Now enter the bottom
	left transporter.  Go down and step on the switch and then go up and
	step on another switch.  Now go down and left until you come to stairs
	going down.  Go down as far as you can and then go right.  Follow this
	path until you have a choice of going left or right.  Go right and 
	step on the switch.  Before entering the path that opens, go to your
	far right and get a Beret from the blue orb.  Now go back to the
	transporter and go down to another transporter which leads to a save
	spot.  Save your game and then go back up and enter the other
	transporter.  When you go down the stairs you have a choice of
	returning to the airship.  Go left and up where you'll meet 
	AtmaWeapon. After defeating it, Shadow splits again.  Go up and you'll
	find Kefka and Gestahl.  Celes comes and join you.  Kefka moves the
	Goddesses out of alignment.  When Shadow comes back run like crazy.
	You have 6 minutes to get away.  To get the blue orb containing an
	Elixir go around to the right side and then go up to it (approaching
	it from the left side will cause the floor to fall away).  Once 
	you reach something that looks like a save spot, examine it and you'll 
	fight Nerapa.  After you beat Nerapa run to the edge and choose 'wait' 
	twice then just sit there. When there is 5 seconds left Shadow will
	come and jump with you.  This is the end of the World of Balance.
			--World of Ruin - One Year Later--
(1) Solitary Island
	You wake up as Celes on a small island.  It seems you and Cid are the
	only ones there.  Leave the house and go south to the beach.  Catch
	the fish and return to Cid.  You can save Cid from dying by feeding
	him the fast-moving fish or kill him by feeding him the slow-moving 
	fish (or just not feeding him). If Cid dies then Celes will go throw 
	herself off a cliff, else Cid will just show her the raft and the
	following about the seagull won't happen.  The seagull will nurse 
        her back to health.  Return to the house and read the letter
	next to the bed.  Follow its instructions by going down the stairway
	hidden in the lefthand wall.  There you'll find a raft.  Examine it
	and you're on your way to Albrook. Note: Don't forget to equip yourself.

		       HyperWrist, Tincture, Pearl Rod, Heal Rod
	As you walk up the stairs to enter the town, the "Light of Judgement"
	hits the town.  Go to the back of town to where Sabin is holding up
	a house.  If you don't have a Jewel Ring go to the Relic Shop and
	buy one.  Equip it and enter the house.  You have 6 minutes to save
	the kid and get out.  So save the kid and the get as many treasures
	as you can leaving yourself enough time to get out.  Avoid two chests:
	the one next to the stairs going down and the one to the left of the
	kid.  When you get out safely, Sabin will join you.  Leave town and
	go to the far east to Mobliz.

    Items: Check barrel next to far left house for Fenix Down
    BOSS: Phunbaba
    Espers: Fenrir
	Go into the house the kid enters and then down stairs.  Here you find
	Terra.  After the flashback, leave the cave and Phunbaba attacks the
	village.  Terra tries fighting it but is defeated easily.  It's up
	to Celes and Sabin. After scaring it away Terra won't go with you but
	a kid will give you the Esper Fenrir.  Now leave town and head
	northwest to Nikeah.

(5) Nikeah
	Enter the Cafe and talk to everyone.  Go out and follow the thieves

	leave town.  When you're done shopping head west to the Cave of Figaro.

(7) Cave of Figaro
	As you enter you'll find Sigfried.  He says to wait there but don't
	listen to him.  There is nothing new in the part of the cave since
	lst time you were here so just keep going until you reach the thieves.
	Follow thier example and jump onto the turtle.  This part of the cave
	is new to you but all the chests have been looted already, however
	in the second section you can go up to where you'll find Siegfried
	messing around with a chest and when you approach he runs off.  If you
	continue going you'll reach the basement of Figaro Castle.

(8) Basement of Figaro Castle
    Chests: Gravity Rod, Crystal Helm, Ether, X-Potion, Regal Crown
    Item: Search statue in treasure room for Soul Sabre
    BOSS: Tentacles
	Go up the stairs and then continue straight down the other stairs.
	Keep going down.  Eventually you'll reach a room with 3 doors and 4
	chests.  The right door is where you enter this room.  The left door
	leads upstairs to a chest and the middles door leads to Edgar (er...
	Gerad).  Talk to Gerad and he'll finally admit he's Edgar.  He then
	joins your party, just in time to fight 4 Tentacles.  When you've
	beat it, go into the back room and search the statue in the center
	of the room for Soul Sabre.  Now turn around and back track your way
	out of the castle.  As you're going up the stairs the old guy near
	the exit will bring the castle to the surface.  You can go upstairs
	and do some shopping.  When you're ready to go return to the old man
	and have him take you to Kohlingen.

    BOSS: Dullahan
	Go down to Basement 2.  First go left and down.  Grab the chest and
	go north thru the doorway.  Press the switch in the turtle pond.  Then
	go back to the room with the stairs going up and the chest in the
	middle.  Walk down until all you can see is your head, then walk right,
	through the wall.  Go up to the treasure chest when you can't go any
	further and you can get Exp.Egg.  Return the way you came, go up the
	stairs, and then go north through the door and then east as far as
	you can.  Go up thru the door and examine the gravestone.  Go up and
	press the switch and then go south and grab the treasure.  Return
	north and then go west and south thru the indentation.  Jump on the
	turtle and it'll take you across the water.  When you get off press
	the switch then go south.  Examine the four gravestones:
		ERAU	QSSI
		DLRO	WHET
	Now go north past the room with the turtle on your right and into the
	big room where you started Basement 2.  Go west and north thru the
	door.  Examine the gravestone and carve in the following order:
		WEHT DLRO QSSI ERAU
	"The World Is Square" backwards.  This tells you where the Exp.Egg
	is (just in case you didn't read above ;)  Now return to the room
	with the turtle on your right and hop on it.  Your're now in a room
	with a save spot and 2 chests.  The left one is a monster-in-a-box.
	Defeat the Presenter and you get Dragon Claw.  Once you get the
	treasures go up and examine the big statue.  This will cause 
	Dullahan to attack.  After you defeat it a passage will open up in
	the back, enter it and you've got yourself a new airship.

	The 1st section is straight forward, just walk around getting treasure.
	At the end of the 1st section you'll find two exits.  The left one
	gets you more treasure and the right one continues onward.  Eventually
	you'll find Cyan.  After you have controll again return to where you
	foudn Cyan and get the key to the locked chest.  Now return to the
	save spot and then go over and step on the switch.  This will release
	the Storm Drgn.  After you beat it you'll get Force Armor.  Only 7
	more dragons to go.  Now back track your way out of the cave (or use
	the warp stone/spell).  Once you're out return to the airship and head
	towards the cave in the Veldt.

    Chests: Rage Ring, Monster-in-a-box(Allo Ver), Striker
    Additional items: Allo Ver gives you Tiger Fangs
    BOSS: SrBehemoth (Gray and Pink)
	When you defeat Allo Ver you get Tiger Fangs.  In that wall you
	walked thru to get to the monster-in-a-box, you can also go down
	in a spot to reach another section of the cave.  Follow the path
	and eventually you'll reach a door with a switch to the right of it.
	Pull the switch and go through the path it opens.  Continue
	following this path and eventually you'll find Shadow (or Relm if you
	abandoned Shadow back on the Floating Island).  As you're examining
	his wounds you're attacked by a SrBehemoth.  After defeating the
	SrBehemoths you'll take Shadow (or Relm) to Thamasa.

(14)Thamasa
	Go to the Inn and rest.  When you wake up return to Shadow and check
	up on him.  How return to the airship, reduce your party to 3 members,
	and go back to the Veldt.  You'll see more of Shadow (or Relm) later.

    Veldt
    Party: 3 members
	Wander around until Gau joins you.  Now return to the small island
	you started at.  If you return to Thamasa you'll find out that 
	Shadow has gone to the Colosseum (that is if Shadow is still alive).
	If you take Sabin and Gau to the shack located on the big island
	north of the Veldt, you'll learn more about Gau's past.

(1) Solitary Island
    Espers: Palidor
	Go to the beach where you caught the fish for Cid.  Here you'll find
	the Esper Palidor.  Return to the airship and go to the Colosseum.

(15)Colosseum 
	Here you'll find some information.  You can also fight monsters
	one-on-one for prizes.  Bet the Striker (found in the cave in the 
	Veldt) and you'll fight Shadow.  He'll join you after the fight.
	When you're done playing around in the Colosseum return to the
	airship and go to Jidoor.

    BOSS: Chadarnook
    Esper: Starlet
	You can bid in the auction house if you didn't before going to the 
	Floating Island (see section called The Auction House for more).  Enter 
	the big house at the north part of town.  Try going up the stairs.  
	You'll be pushed back and a book will appear on the desk.  Read it.  Go 
	to the light next to the stairs and push A to turn it on.  Examine the 
	picture of Emperor Gestahl twice and you'll receive information.  
	Examine the picture of the flowers and you'll be attacked by some 
	Nightshade.  Now examine the picture of a lovely lady. This time you'll 
	be attacked by Dahlings.  Kill them and enter the door that appears.  
	Examine the picture of a chair and you'll be attacked by Souldancer and 
	some Wild Cats.  The left door leads to a chest.  After getting the 
	chest go through the right door.  You'll come to some "revolving 
	doors".  In the little pathway behind the doors there is a hidden 
	chest.  The middle and right doors take you back to the room with a 
	picture of a chair.  Obviously the left door is the right way to go :)  
	Keep going and you'll come to a room with some floating chests.  Walk 
	underneath them and they'll fall (and you'll get attacked).  Examine 
	the picture of armor and you'll have to fight Still Life.
	Enter the door that appears when you defeat it.  You're
	now in a room with a save spot and 2 doors.  The left one takes you
	back a few rooms.  The right one leads to a big room where you find
	Owzer and Relm.  Talk to Owzer and you'll find out what happened and
	will be asked to defeat Chadarnook, the monster in the painting.  
	After you defeat it you can get the Esper Starlet by examining the
	book case and Relm will join you.
	Now exit the town and add Cyan to your party (if he's not already in
	it).  Go back to Maranda and talk to Lola.  Examine the letter on the
	desk and Cyan will switch it with another one.  Now return to
	Mobliz.

(4) Mobliz
    Items: Examine the pot in the cave where Terra & Katarin are for Ether
    BOSS: Phunbaba
	Go down to the cave where you first found Terra.  All the kids say
	Katarin is missing.  Exit the house and go to the house to the left
	of it.  Here you'll find Duane.  Notice where the dog went.  There's
	a secret passage behind the bookshelf.  Here you'll find Terra and
	Katarin.  While you're down there, Phunbaba will return.  You'll
	have to defeat him again.  Return to the surface and you'll face it.
	After defeating it, Terra is back in your party.  The characters that
	Phunbaba blew away are on the airship.  Return to the airship and go
	either fight Doom Gaze or go to the Fanatics' Tower.

    Fight Doom Gaze
    BOSS: Doom Gaze
    Esper: Bahamut
	At this point it may be a good idea to fight Doom Gaze.  Fly around
	the map and eventually he'll attack you.  He escapes after a while
	but the next time you meet with it its hps will not have regenerated.
	So if you continue to run into it, eventually you'll kill it.  And
	when you do the Esper Bahamut it yours.  You may want to fly around
	until you defeat it.  It's worth it to get Bahamut.

(20)Fanatics' Tower
	Before you enter put Relm in your party.  Now enter the tower.  Relm
	will get Strago's attention and he'll join you.  Don't actually try
	going up the tower yet, you`ll have your chance later.  For now
	return to the airship and go to the center of where the mountains
	form a star (north of Tzen).  Push B to descend.

(17) Phoenix Cave
     Party: 2 groups with 4 members each
     Chests: Wing Edge, Warp Stone, Ribbon, Dragon Horn
     BOSS: Red Dragon (**DRAGON #2**)
	Have your first group (G1) enter the cave and step on the switch.
	Now switch to your other group (G2) and have them enter the path that
	opened.  At the top of the stairs go left and try to get the chest.
	You'll fall down a level.  Go south and up the stairs.  Step on the
	switch and get the chest.  Go east past the stairs and down to a switch.
	Change to G1 and enter the passage that opens when G2 stepped on the
	switch.  Step on the switch that you come to as you go north.  Switch
	back to G2 and go north past where the spikes were, and then right until
	you come to another switch.  Step on it and switch back to G1 again.
	The chest is empty but go down and you should find a hidden room thru
	the wall containing a chest with a warp stone in it.  After you get it
	return to where you were and go down the stairs. Go left and
	step on the switch (the chest is empty).  Now turn around and go the
	opposite way.  Keep going past the chest (this one's empty too).
	When you come to a dead end switch to G2.  Go left, past the spikes,
	and down the stairs.  Go right onto the bridge and jump across on the
	little stones.  Turn around and go back on the top set of stones.
	Don't worry about the chest (it's empty).  Press the switch and change
	to G1.  Have G1 go up thru the spot that just opened and then around
	and back down to a switch.  Step on the switch and then change to G2.
	Go up and step on the switch you find.  Switch back to G1 again and
	go up, across the spot where the spikes were, and the down.  Jump
	from stone to stone.  Keep doing this and eventually you'll reach a
	stairway leading up.  Go up it and pull the switch you find.  Now go
	down as far as you can a switch back to G2.  Go left and step on the
	switch.  Switch back to G1 and go down where you'll find the Red 
	Dragon. You can fight it now or wait until later.  Take G2 and go down
	and left.  Follow this path and you'll come to where the lava was
	cooled off.  Walk out and get the chest in the center (this one isn't
	empty :) then go over to the left side and go up.  Follow this path
	until you can't go any farther and switch to G1.  Go and step on the
	top switch.  Now have G2 jump across the sones that appeared and then
	have them go down and step on one of the switches then switch groups
	and have them step on the other switch.  Take you strongest group and
	go fight the Red Dragon (if you haven't already) and then after you
	kill it have the other group go down and you'll find Locke.  You'll
	now automatically return to Kohlingen.
	NOTE: If for some reason you return to the Phoenix Cave you can
	      instantly return to the airship by going to where you found Locke.
	      Here you can press to the right and you'll hop over some rocks
	      to a platform where you'll find the transporter (it looks like
	      a red save spot).
(9) Kohlingen
    Items: X-Potion, Fenix Down, X-Ether, Elixir, Flame Shld, ValiantKnife
    Espers: Phoenix
	Here you'll receive the Esper Phoenix plus all the stuff that was in
	the chests that you found empty: X-Potion, Fenix Down, X-Ether, Elixir,
	Flame Shld, and ValiantKnife.  Now it's on to Narshe.

(18)Narshe
    Chests: Gauntlet, X-Ether, Monster-in-a-box(Pugs)
    Additional items: Cursed Shld, Moogle Charm, Minerva, possibly the
		      Ragnarok sword (depends on your choice), and possibly
		      a Ribbon (depends on if you already got the chest or not)
    BOSS: Ice Dragon (**DRAGON #3**), Tritoch, Umaro
    Espers: Ragnarok, Tritoch, Terrato
	As you enter Lone Wolf come out and tell you some stuff.  Almost all
	the buildings are locked.  If you have Locke he can open them.  Go
	to the house with no markings and have Locke get you in.  Inside
	you'll find a man in bed who'll give you Cursed Shld.  Equip this 
	shield to someone.  It may be a pain for a while, but in 255 battles
	it'll all be worth it.  (Being equipped for 255 fights removes the
	curse and changes the shield into the Paladin Shld which teaches the
	Ultima spell [equip a Ribbon to counteract the effects of the Shld]).  
	Go to the Weapon Shop and have Locke get you in.  In the
 	back room you'll find and old man.  Talk to him.  He'll give you a 
	choice of either getting the Esper Ragnarok or making it into a sword.  
	Tough choice: the sword is VERY powerful (and can be bet in the 
	Colosseum for an even more powerful sword) but the Esper teaches you the
 	most powerful spell in the game - Ultima.  Once you've decided (I'd go 
	for the Esper) enter the mines thru the secret passage Locke showed you 
	or thru the entrance behind Arvis' house, and then go to the Moogle Cave
	where you'll find Mog waiting to join you.  Once he's out of the way,
	search the wall behind him for the Moogle Charm [also in this cave 
	is a chest that may contain a Ribbon if you didn't get the Rune Sword
	that was in it in the World of Balance].  Return to the airship
	and add Mog to your party.  Now go back into Narshe and go north to the
	mines where you first saw Umaro (straight back from the entrance of
	town).  Once inside the mines take a right, and continue following
	that path until you reach the Ice Dragon.  You may want to go past
	the dragon to the save spot before fighting it.  After defeating it
	continue north to the frozen Esper Tritoch.  You'll have to fight it
	before you can have it.  Now go to the edge of the cliff and jump off.
	You'll land in a new area of the mines.  Wander around and you'll
	be able to find 3 chests.  The monster-in-a-box guards Minerva armor.
	When you come to a switch, pass it up, cross the bridge and pull that
	switch.  When you fall down search the skull carving and you'll get
	the Esper Terrato.  Then Umaro will come down and attack you.  When
	you defeat him and if Mog is in your party, he'll join you.  If you
	follow him out you'll end up just below the spot where you first saw
	Umaro.  Enter the mines to your left.  Follow that path and you're
	on your way out.  Once you're out of Narshe go to Triangle Island.

(19)Triangle Island
	Wander around until you get attacked.  The only monster on the island
	is the ZoneEater.  If you kill it it's worth 1000 xp, but in order
	to continue you must have all four of your characters get engulfed,
	so just sit there.  Once you get engulfed you'll be in a cave.

(19)Cave in Triangle Island
    Chests: Ether, Red Jacket, Genji Armor, Magical Brsh, FakeMustache,
		Zephyr Cape, Hero Ring, Tack Star, Thunder Shld
	To get out go north and step into the light.  To get Gogo go down and
	left.  Push A to jump from bridge to bridge but try not to touch
	the little green guys because they'll knock you down (get knocked
	down at least once for some treause).  Once past the save spot you'll
	come to a room with a moving wall.  If you get caught by the wall
	you die.  To get past it stop behing the first chest and go as soon
	as you can move.  Do the same for the second chest.  For the third
	chest go down from it and then when you can move go up and get
	the chest then quickly come back down again.  After that spot you come
	to a room with open chests.  Press A to jump onto a chest and then
	across.  When you can, jump across to the switch, now you can reach
	a tresure on the left side of the room.  When you're ready go thru
	the door.  Here you'll find Gogo the copycat.  He'll join you.  To
	get out you can either backtrack or use a warp stone/spell.  Next
	stop...Fanatics' Tower.

(20)Fanatic's Tower
    Party: I suggest taking Umaro, Gogo and your two best magic users.
    Chests: Safety Bit, Air Anchor, Genji Shld, Stunner, Force Armor, Gem Box
    Additional items: Pearl Lance
    BOSS: White Dragon (**DRAGON #4**), MagiMaster
	If you use Gogo make sure to add the Fight (yes Fight, not Magic)
	command to his list.  If you use Mog you can equip him with the
	Moogle Charm and put him in the lead for an easy time getting up
	the tower.  If you cast Bserk on your party they'll attack with weapons
	and you can save your mps for healing and stuff.  If you don't have
	Life3 then equip the Esper that teaches it and keep fighting until you 
	learn it (you can beat the boss of the tower without Life3 but it takes
	a LONG time or a shit load of hps).  Each level has a doorway (there
 	are four levels plus the roof).  In the first level door go to the
	right of the chest and press A.  When you leave you'll see another
	door below you.  Inside is an Air Anchor.  The third level door leads
	to the White Dragon.  You get Pearl Lance when you defeat it.  Once on
	the roof get the Gem Box and equip it to someone (the one with the best 
	spells).  Now, if you have Life3 (or Rasp, Bserk, and the Fenrir epser
	equipped to do it the long way) then exit the room,if not wander around 
	the room and battle monsters until you get it (make sure the Esper 
	equipped teaches it).  When you've got Life3 exit the room and try to 
	leave.  You'll be stopped by the MagiMaster. After you defeat him you 
	have to climb back down the tower (this is the time you'll want Mog in 
	the lead with the Moogle Charm). Now go to Doma Castle.

    Party: Cyan and 3 others

	Make sure you have Cyan in your party.  Go to the room to the right
	of the throne room for treasure.  Enter the door south of this room
	and follow the path until you reach a door which leads to a couple
	more chests.  Now return to the hall leading to the throne room.  Go
	south from the throne room door and then into the right door.  Search
	the pot then go left  and enter the second door you come to.  Get the
	chest and then goo back and enter the door you passed up.  Take a nap.

(21)Cyan's Soul
    Party: the party you took to Doma Castle minus Cyan
    Chests: Genji Glove, Lump of metal, Flame Shld, X-Potion, Ice Shld
    BOSS: The 3 Dream Stooges, Wrexsoul
    Espers: Alexandr
	You start out with one of the 3 characters in a weird dreamworld.
	Head left and enter the right door and then the next right door.  Now
	you can go down and get another of your charcters back.  Now enter	
	the door, go right and enter that door.  Now go left again and this
	time enter the left door.  Go down and get you remaining character.
	Enter the door.  Now enter the top door, then the door on the right,
	and then the only door there.  Now go right and enter the door.  Go
	down and try entering the door.  Larry, Curly, and Moe will attack.
	Enter the door and you'll find yourself on a train.  Go left into the
	train car.  In the second car pull the switch twice as you enter and 
	get the treasure.  Now go to the far left of the car and get the Lump
	of Metal from the chest.  Return right, to the open chest that moves.  
	Push A and you'll put the Metal into the chest allowing you to get by
	it and get the chest in the back. Now go left and pull the switch, 
	notice which chests close.  Continue left into the next car.  Notice 
	there is a chest just to the left of the entrance on the other side of 
	the couch.  There are 4 switches. To continue use them in the following 
	order (they are numbered 1 to 4, from right to left): 1, 2, 1, 3.  Now 
	you can reach switch #4. Before pulling it, close the chests so they 
	match the set-up in the previous car:
		open	open	closed
		closed	closed	open
	Once you have the chests set up like above, pull the switch and the
	wall will open allowing you to go on to the next car.  Enter the 
	engine room and then attempt to exit.  You'll find yourself in some
	mines.  Go down and follow the path until you re-enter the cave.  As
	soon as you enter the cave turn around and exit.  You'll end up in
	a new spot.  Trying to cross the bridge you'll fall and end up in the
	sleeping chambers of Doma Castle. Before going to the throne room
	where Wrexsoul awaits take some time to explore.  There are 3 little
	scenes that deal with Cyan's life that you can see: one in the
	room to the right of the throne room ('I loveth thee'), one on left
	side of the castle (fencing lesson), and one on the right side of
	the castle (fishing).  Go to the throne room where you'll find 
	Wrexsoul.  After defeating Wrexsoul Cyan will rejoin your party capable 
	of using all 8 SwdTechs and you'll wake up back in the sleeping 
	chambers.  Go to the throne room and you'll find the Esper Alexandr.  
	Now return to the airship and go north to Duncan's House (it's where 4 
	trees make a plus (+) sign just below some mountains.  His house is the 
	center tree).

(22)Duncan's House
    Party: Include Sabin
	Make sure you have Sabin in your party.  As you enter the house
	Duncan will come out and teach Sabin the Bum Rush blitz.  Now go
	to Figaro Castle.

(7) Figaro Castle
    Party: who ever you want
	Enter the castle and go down the stairs to you left.  Talk to the guy
	and have him take you back to Figaro.  On the way you'll get stuck.
	Stop and explore.  Go up the stairs and then down the other ones. 
	In the back of the far right jail cell is a doorway.  Enter it and
	you'll be on you way to the Ancient Castle.

(23)Cave to Ancient Castle
    Chests: Ether, Wing Edge, Doom Darts, monster-in-a-box(Master Pug),
	    Magicite, X-Potion
    Additional items: Gradeus
	When you defeat the Master Pug (monster-in-a-box) you'll receive
	Gradeus.  Once you reach a room with a stairway going down into a 
	hole, get the two chests in that room then go down the stairs, past
	the save spot and up some stairs.  You're now at the Ancient Castle.

(23)Ancient Castle
    Chests: Blizzard Orb, Gold Hairpin, Punisher, Monster-in-a-box(KatanaSoul) 	
    Itemes: search a bucket for X-Ether
    Additional items: Offering
    BOSS: Blue Dragon (**DRAGON #5**)
    Espers: Odin, Raiden
	Go straigh into the castle intil you reach the statue of Odin.
	Examine it and you'll get the Esper Odin.  Stand on the right throne
	and walk five steps down.  Press A and a secret passage will open.
	In the secret room you'll find a staue of a girl and the Blue Dragon.
	Defeat the dragon then examine the statue.  This will change the 
	Esper Odin into the Esper Raiden.  Once you've visited all four rooms
	that go off from the throne room (one on the left, one on the right,
	one to the north, plus the secret one) then return outside.  A couple
	steps to the right of the stairs is a door.  Enter and get the chest.
	Now enter one of the doors to the left of the stairs.  When you 
	defeat the monster-in-a-box(KatanaSoul) you get Offering.  Now
	return to Figaro castle by going back the way you came and have the
	guy continue your journey to Figaro.  Once you get there talk to him
	again and have him take you back to Kohlingen so you can get your
	airship.  Now go to Thamasa.

(14)Thamasa
    Party: include Strago and Relm
	As you enter you'll find ou that Gungho is hurt.  You find out that
	Hidon did it and that Gungho wants you to avenge him.  Now go to
	Ebot's Rock (called Eboshi Rock on the map).

(24)Ebot's Rock
    Chests: all the chests contain Coral
    BOSS: Hidon
	As you enter step on the switch to be transported.  North of where
	you appear is a Coral eating treasure chest.  Wander around the cave,
	stepping on switches to get around, and pick up coral from the chests.
	If you end up back at the coral eating chest, feed it.  If you've 
	fed it enought he'll let you thru.  If not go get more coral.  Once
	it lets you thru go straight north and you'll find Hidon.  Kill
	the Hidonites and Hidon will cast Grand Train (Strago's most powerful
	Lore). After you beat Hidon you'll return to Thamasa to brag to Gungho.
	Now go to the Opera House.
	NOTE: To make Hidon reset all you have to do is talk to Gungho a few
	      times.

(25)Opera House
    BOSS: Dirt Drgn (**DRAGON #6**)
	Equip as many characters in your party as you can with Gaia stuff.
	If you have some on each character it'll make life much easier for
	you.  Go to the balcany and talk to Impressario.  You'll learn
	there is a dragon on the stage.  Go northeast to where the stage
	master and 4 switches are.  The rightmost switch won't do anything.
	The lefmost switch barks and the one right next to that turns the
	lights off.  Pulling the only one left will cause you to fall to
	the stage where you'll have to fight the Dirt Drgn.  To see your
	character jump on the heads of the audience go back to the switches
	after you defeat the dragon and pull the one that drops you to the
	stage.  Next and final stop -- Kefka's Tower.

(26)Kefka's Tower
    Party: 3 groups of 4
    Chests: Coronet, Fixed Dice, Minerva, 2 Tack Stars, Force Shld, Force Armor

    BOSS: Atma, Gold Dragon (**DRAGON #7**), Inferno,Skull Drgn (**DRAGON #8**),
          Doom, Goddess, Guardian, Poltrgiest
    Espers: If you killed all 8 dragons you get Crusader
    Note: When you find the chest with the Hero Ring in it search the south
	  wall to find a secret passage to a room where a chest is that
	  contains an Aegis Shld.
	Your 3 groups will land in 3 different areas of the tower.  Each
	group will be designated as follows:  G1 wil be the group that landed
	on the left side of the tower, G2 will be the group in the middle,
	and G3 will be the group on the right.  You start as G1.
	G1: Go around to your right and get the chest then enter the little
	    hatchway to your left.  Continue on this path until you come to
	    a dead end.  You should see a switch and a chest on the other
	    side of the room.
        G2: When you have to choose between going up and down, go up first
	    and get the treasure then go down.  Going down will lead to a
	    prison.  In the far left cell you'll find Atma.  Defeat it and
	    it'll change into a save spot.  Now go down out of the prison
	    and continue on that path until you have to choose between two
	    pipes.  Don't go in the rightmost pipe, it'll just take you back
	    before the prison.  Enter the left pipe.  Before you enter the
	    hatchway that you find, go to your far left to get a chest. 
	    Enter the hatchway, step on the switch and get the chest, then
	    go back up and enter the door to you right.  Keep going staight
	    and you'll reach the Gold Dragon.  After defeating it you get
	    the Crystal Orb.  Now continue you journey.  When you reach a room
	    with a switch, stand on it and switch groups.
	G3: First enter the hatchway that is next to the chest to get two more
	    chests then come back and enter the other hatchway.  Continue on
	    that path and you'll eventually reach a save spot.  A few more
	    steps and you'll get attacked by Inferno, Striker, and Rough
	    (a big ol' monster and it claws).  Once you've defeated them
	    continue on your journey.  When you get to a chest with a glowing
	    thing on it, examine it to open up a passage that your other group
	    will need to get past.  Then keep going and you'll reach the 
	    Skull Drgn.  When you defeat it you'll get the Muscle Belt.  If
	    you've killed the other 7 dragons, you'll also receive the Esper
	    Crusader.  Keep going and you'll end up on the other side of the
	    room you left G2 in.  Stand on the switch.
        G1: You are no longer at a dead end.  Follow the path and you'll
	    evenentually reach the room your other two groups are in.  
	    Continue straight and then, after you reach the switch, pick a
	    side to go on (it doesn't matter which).  For illustrative
	    purposes I'm gonna say go left.  Now go down.  Move G2 off the
	    switch and then push the weight off the edge.  Now go back inside
	    and stand on the switch.
	G2: Enter the main doorway and do what G1 did, except on the right
	    side.
	G3: Go in through the main door and step on the switch.  This will
	    open up a pathway.  Go south and step on the platform to open up
	    a couple other pathways.
        G1: Go down and out to where you pushed the weight off.  To your left
	    there is a door.  Enter the door and go stright where you'll find
	    Doom.  When you beat it you'll get Sky Render and there will be
            a save spot there.  Now enter the pipe to the north and stand
            on the switch.
	G2: Go down and out to where you pushed the weight off.  To your right
	    is a door.  Enter the door and go staight where you'll find
	    Goddess.  When you beat it you'll get Excalibur and there will
	    be a save spot there.  Enter the door and step on the switch.
 	G3: Go north and you'll be attacked by Guardian (remember it? this
	    time you can beat it thought :)  When you defeat it a save spot
	    will be there.  Go north and keep following that path until you
	    reach Poltrgeist.  Defeating it will get you the AuraLance.  Go
	    north and drop down the hole.  Step on the switch and it's time
	    for the final multi-battle showdown. 
	Put your characters in the order you want them to fight.  The first
	4 in your list will fight 1st.  If anyone of those 4 are dead at the
	end of any of the stages of the last fight the next characters in
	line will replace them.  This goes on until all 4 fighting members
	die or you beat the game.

	For each boss there is a section marked VANISH/DOOM.  If it is marked
	yes then you can cast Vanish on it and then Doom on it to kill it.
	In place of Doom you could also cast X-Zone.  On some monsters only
	X-Zone will work (those are marked X-Zone only).

		VANISH/DOOM: no
          Depending on who's in the group you fight him with will determine
          how hard he is.  Those that can't do much damage will take longer
          to defeat him.  Here is my strategies for each person:
               Terra - cure or attack           Locke - attack
               Edgar - AutoCrossbow             Sabin - AuraBolt
               Celes - Runic                    Cyan  - SwdTech 1

   Ultros(Opera House) HP: <10000    MP: ????     Weakness: ????
		VANISH/DOOM: no
          Have someone equipped with the Ramuh Esper and have them use it.
          Then have Locke attack, Edgar use Chainsaw or Drill, Sabin AuraBolt,
          Cyan use SwdTech 1, and Gau ????.  One attack from Ramuh and one
	  Chainsaw attack from Edgar should be enough to finish him.
   Guardian            HP: ????     MP: ????     Weakness: ????
		VANISH/DOOM: no
          RUN!!!  At this time nothing there is nothing you can do to hurt it.

          Use lightning spells on the right crane if you have them but don't
          use them on the left crane (they heal it).  Have Setzer either
          attack or use Slot, Locke attack, Edgar use Drill, Sabin AuraBolt,

   FlameEater          HP: 8400     MP: 480      Weakness: Ice
		VANISH/DOOM: no
          Use Shiva or Maduin if you have them equipped.  Also use Ice Rods
          and/or Ice spells if you have them.  Have Locke and Terra attack,
          and Strago us his Aqua Rake lore.
   Ultros part 3       HP: <24000   MP: ????     Weakness: ????
		VANISH/DOOM: yes
          Use your attacking Espers and any attack spells you might have
          (except water-based attacks like Bismark; Ice spells are ok though),

          Have he Sketch and you'll win.
   Ultros and Chupon   Ultros HP: <20000  MP: ????     Weakness: ????

		VANISH/DOOM: yes (for both)
          Use your most powerfull Fire and Bolt spells (fire 2 gets a lot
          of damage) on Ultros.  Take out Ultros first and then go for Chupon.
          Fire spell heal Chupon so don't use them anymore, use Ice spells
          instead.  If you don't have any or have run out of mps do the
          following:  Have Mog dance Wind Song, Cyan use SwdTech 1 or 4,
          Strago use Aqua Rake, Edgar use Chainsaw, Gau ????, Relm attack or
          Sketch, Sabin Pummel, Setzer use slot, and the rest attack.  When

   Air Force           HP: 8000     MP: 750     Weakness: lightning, water
		VANISH/DOOM: no
          Concentrate on the main thing.  If it launches a Speck, attack it
	  (don't use spells). Just use your most powerful attack spells (Ice,
	  Fire, and Bolt), your attack Espers (Maduin, Shiva, Ramuh, etc.),
	  or if neither of those options are possible use your best attacks
	  (Sabin's AuraBolt,  Edgar's Drill, etc.).
   Gigantos            HP: 6000     MP: 1120     Weakness: poison
		VANISH/DOOM: yes
          This dude hits hard so have one person use Cure 2 all the time.
          Have Shadow throw shuriken and have Edgar use Drill, Sabin
          AuraBolt, Cyan use SwdTech 1 or 4, Gau ????, Setzer use Slot/GP 
     	  Rain, Mog do the Earth Blues Dance, Relm Sketch, and the rest attack.
          Also use your most powerful attack spells and Espers.  Also it may
          be a good idea to use the Phantom Esper the first thing (this will
          make you harder to hit for a little while).
   AtmaWeapon          HP: 24000    MP: 5000     Weakness: none
		VANISH/DOOM: yes
          Use your most powerful attacks: Fire, Ice, and Bolt spells;
          attack Espers; regular attacks; and special attacks (Sabin's
          AuraBolt, Edgar's Drill, Mog's Earth Blues dance, Shadow's
          Shuriken throwing, etc.).  It shoud be dead in no time.  Cure as
          needed of course.  Another method to use would be to drain it's
	  mps using Rasp (it'll die when it's mps are gone).
   Nerapa              HP: 2800     MP: 280      Weakness: ice,lightning,pearl
		VANISH/DOOM: no
          He has a wall spell on him so attack spells will just bounce back.
          If you have a wall spell on one of your characters, cast the 
          attack spells on them.  Use your most powerful Espers and attacks.
   Phunbaba            HP: 28000    MP: 10000    Weakness: poison
		VANISH/DOOM: yes
          Don't use lightning attacks (Bolt spells, Ramuh, etc.), it heals
          him.  Use Phantom Esper to make you invisible and Sraphim to cure
          if needed.  Have Celes use spells and have Sabin use the Suplex
          blitz.  He'll run away when his hps get low.
   Tentacle           Top Left  HP: 4000    MP: 500    Weakness: none
                      Bot Left  HP: 6000    MP: 700    Weakness: fire
                      Top Right HP: 5000    MP: 600    Weakness: none
                      Bot Right HP: 7000    MP: 800    Weakness: ice, water
      		VANISH/DOOM: no
	  Don't use Ice spells on the bottom left tentacle or fire spells
          on the bottom right one or bolt spells on the top left one. Have
          Edgar use Drill, Celes attack, and Sabin attack the bottom right one
	  and then use Fire Dance when it's dead.  If you have attack Espers
	  use them.  Also use spells that correspond to the weakness of a
	  tentacle (example: use fire on the bottom left one).
   Presenter           HP: 9845     MP: 1600     Weakness: fire
		VANISH/DOOM: yes (on the shell only)
          Have Celes attack, Sabin AuraBolt, Setzer attack or Slot/GP Rain,
	  and Edgar use Chainsaw or Drill.  Also use Fire spells if 
          you have them.  Just cast Doom on the head to make it a quick fight.
   Dullahan            HP: 23450    MP: 1721     Weakness: fire
		VANISH/DOOM: yes
          Use fire spells and the Esper Ifrit if you have it equipped. 
          Have Celes Runic, Sabin Suplex, Setzer attack or Slot/GP Rain, and
	  Edgar use Chainsaw or Drill.
   Storm Drgn          HP: 42000    MP: 1250     Weakness: lightning
		VANISH/DOOM: yes
          Use Ramuh and Bolt spells.  If a person doesn't have bolt spells
          have them use there best attacks.  If you went back and added 
          Cyan to your party, have him do either SwdTech 1 or 4.  Also cure
          whenever needed.
   Allo Ver            HP: 8000     MP: 8000     Weakness: fire, pearl
		VANISH/DOOM: yes (X-Zone only)
          The only hard part about this creature is that he can use Doom,
          which instantly kills its target.  Just keep attacking or casting
          fire spells until it dies.
   SrBehemoth          1st one HP: 19000   MP: 1600    Weakness: fire, poison
                       2nd one HP: 19000   MP: 9999    Weakness: fire, pearl
		VANISH/DOOM: yes (for the 1st one, X-Zone only for 2nd one)
          Use fire spells plus have Edgar use Chainsaw, Setzer use Slot/GP
          Rain, Celes attack, Sabin attack, and Cyan use SwdTech 1 or 4. 
          After defeating the 1st one, a second one will attack from behind.
          Defeat this one the same way, or you can use revivify to kill it
	  instantly.
   Chadarnook       Demon HP: 56000    MP: 9400     Weakness: fire
	 	    Woman HP: 30000    MP: ????	    Weakness: fire,pearl
		VANISH/DOOM: yes (X-Zone only)
	  Have Edgar use Drill and everyone else use either fire spells 
	  or their best attacks.
   Phunbaba:The Return HP: 26000    MP: 10000    Weakness: poison
		VANISH/DOOM: yes
          You can defeat it basically the same way as before.  Have Edgar
          use Drill, Sabin Suplex, Celes Runic, Cyan use SwdTech 1 or 4,
          Gau ????, Shadow throw Shuriken, and Setzer attack or Slot/GP Rain.
	  After a while, it'll use BabaBreath to blow a couple of your
	  characters away.  Terra will join you to finish it off.  (After
	  Terra joins, Phunbaba's hps and mps reset). Have Terra attack.
   Doom Gaze           HP: 55555    MP: 38000    Weakness: fire, pearl
   		VANISH/DOOM: yes (DON'T use X-Zone or you won't get Bahamut)
          Whenever you happen to run into it, just beat the hell out of it
          with your best attacks.  Use life spells and Fenix Down to bring
          back dead companions if you feel like it.  It'll run from you
          rather quickly but it can't regenerate itself between fights, so
          next time you fight it it'll have the same amount of hps as it
          did when it ran.  Eventually you'll kill it.  Killing it will 
          get you the Esper Bahamut.
   Red Dragon          HP: 30000    MP: 1780     Weakness: ice, water
		VANISH/DOOM: yes
          Use Ice spells if you have them.  Have Terra attack, Edgar use
          Drill or Chainsaw, Sabin attack, Celes attack or Runic, Cyan
          use SwdTech 1 or 4, Gau ????, Setzer attack or Slot/GP Rain,
          Strago use the Aqua Rake lore, and Relm attack.
   Ice Dragon          HP: 24400    MP: 9000     Weakness: fire
		VANISH/DOOM: yes
          Use fire spells or if you don't have them use your best attacks.
   Tritoch             HP: 30000    MP: 50000    Weakness: fire
		VANISH/DOOM: yes
          Use fire spells or best attacks to thaw it out.
   Umaro               HP: 17200    MP: 6990     Weakness: fire, poison
		VANISH/DOOM: no
          Use fire spells or best attacks.  Don't use Tritoch, Shiva, or
          Ice spells because it'll heal him.
   White Dragon        HP: 18500    MP: 1200     Weakness: none
		VANISH/DOOM: yes
          Use Ultima and Flare if you have them.  Have Gogo Mimic or cast 
	  spells, and everyone else use thier most powerful spells and Espers.
   MagiMaster          HP: 50000    MP: 50000    Weakness: varies
		VANISH/DOOM: no
          METHOD 1: Don't bother using elemental spells (fire,ice,bolt,etc)     
        	    because the MagiMaster constantly changes what spells heal
          	    and hurt him. Using Beserk on him stops him from doing this.
  	  	    Instead use spells like Ultima and Flare, plus Espers like
		    Bahamut and Maduin. Also make ABSOLUTELY SURE AT LEAST ONE 
		    CHARACTER HAS LIFE 3 ON THEM becasue when MagiMaster dies
		    he casts Ultima on your party and unless you have a helluva
		    lot of hps your toast.
	  METHOD 2: Cast Beserk on him and use the Phantom esper on your party.
		    Now continually cast Rasp on him (or Osmose if your MPS
		    get really low).  When his 50000 mps are gone he'll try
		    to cast Ultima but since he has no mps he'll fail and die.
		    NOTE: It takes a long time to beat him this way but once
			you cast Bserk on him and used Phantom on you, he
			can't hurt you at all. 
   The 3 Stooges  Left/ Larry HP: 10000   MP: 2000    Weakness: fire
                   Top/ Curly HP: 15000   MP: 2000    Weakness: ice, water
                 Right/ Moe   HP: 12000   MP: 2000    Weakness: none
		VANISH/DOOM: yes (all three of them)
           Use Ultima and Bahamut if you have them.  If not just use your 
           best attacks and spells, taking note what spells heal which
           stooge.
   WrexSoul            HP: 23066    MP: 5066     Weakness: Ice
		VANISH/DOOM: ??
   	   For a quick battle use X-Zone (it'll suck in the SoulSavers and
	   you'll win the fight).  If you don't have X-Zone then don't worry 
	   about the SoulSavers.  You first have to attack one of your 
	   characters until they die. This will cause WrexSoul to appear in a 
	   form you can kill.  Once he has appeared bring your dead character
	   back to life and then use Ultima, Bahamut, and Ice spells, or your
	   best attacks.  If he disappears, repeat the process only kill a
	   different character this time.
   Master Pug          HP: 22000    MP: 1200     Weakness: none
		VANISH/DOOM: yes
           Use Ultima, Flare, and Bahamut.  Have Edgar use Drill or Chainsaw,
           Sabin use Bum Rush, Celes use Runic, Cyan use SwdTech 7, Gau
           ????, Setzer attack or Slot/GP Rain, and everyone else attack.
   Blue Dragon         HP: 26900    MP: 3800     Weakness: lightning
		VANISH/DOOM: yes
           Use your best spells (Ultima, Meteor, Flare, etc), your best
           Espers (Bahamut, etc.), and attacks (Sabin's Bum Rush, Edgar's
           Drill, etc.).
   KatanaSoul          HP: 37620    MP: 7400     Weakness: poison
		VANISH/DOOM: yes
           Use Ultima for major damage.  Otherwise use your best attacks
           (Espers, spells, regular, and special).
   Hidon               HP: 25000    MP: 12500    Weakness: fire,pearl,earth
		VANISH/DOOM: yes (X-Zone only)
           Use Pearl on Hidon if you have it.  Don't worry about the
           Hidonites.  Also use Ultima, Meteor, Flare, Bahamut, Terrato, etc.
           plus special attacks.
   Dirt Drgn           HP: 28500    MP: 16500    Weakness: wind, water
		VANISH/DOOM: yes
           If you have some sort of Gaia equipment on a lot of the dragon's
           spells will heal you.  Ultima works quite will.  Use it if you
           have it, if not use your other more powerful attacks.
   Atma                HP: 55000    MP: 19000    Weakness: none
		VANISH/DOOM: yes
           Ultima works quite well.  Use it along with the best attacks
           of the members of your party.  Another way to do it is to try
	   depleting its MPS by using spells like rasp (it'll die when its
	   MPS are drained completely).
   Gold Dragon         HP: 32400    MP: 4000     Weakness: water
		VANISH/DOOM: yes
           Don't use lightning based spells (Bolt, Ramuh, etc.).  DO use
           Ultima, Bahamut, Flare, Meteor, etc.  Using your best attacks 
           should be safe as long as they don't involve lightning.
   Inferno & Company   Rough   HP: 8000    MP: 770    Weakness: ice
                       Inferno HP: 30800   MP: 9700   Weakness: lightning
                       Striker HP: 11000   MP: 2600   Weakness: fire
		VANISH/DOOM: no
           Striker is the claw on the right and Rough is the left one.  
           Don't worry about the claws, concentrate on Inferno.  If you
           use Ultima, Meteor, Bahamut, or some other spell/Esper that
           attacks all enemies then you don't have to worry about anything.
           Use your best attacks.
   Skull Drgn          HP: 32800    MP: 1999    Weakness: fire, pearl
		VANISH/DOOM: yes
           Use fire spells and pearl as the basis of your attack.  Ultima,
           Flare, Bahamut, etc. work good too.
   Doom                HP: 63000    MP: 4800    Weakness: pearl
		VANISH/DOOM: yes 
           Use Ultima for major damage.  Also use your other major attacks.
           Once he uses his force field don't use spells that'll bounce
           off a wall (elementals, flare, etc.).
   Goddess             HP: 44000     MP: 19000    Weakness: none
		VANISH/DOOM: yes
           Use your more powerful spells (Ulima, Meteor, etc.) and attacks
           (Sabin's Bum Rush, etc.)
   Guardian again      HP: 60000    MP: 5200    Weakness: lightning, water
		VANISH/DOOM: no
           Use lightning spells along with your best attacks (spells or 
           otherwise).  If you have Sabin have him do the Bum Rush blitz
           for some good damage.
   Poltrgeist          HP: 58000    MP: 18900   Weakness: poison
		VANISH/DOOM: no
           Again, use your best attacks (Ultima, Flare, Bum Rush, etc).
           Ice 3 seems to work pretty good, too.
   Final Fight Lvl 1   (approximate values for hps)
		Head   HP: 30000    MP: ????    Weakness: ????
	     Left Hand HP: 27000    MP: ????    Weakness: ????
	    Right Hand HP: 32000    MP: ????    Weakness: ????
		VANISH/DOOM: no
           Here you have to destroy the creatures head and both hands.  Use
           your best attacks and it'll go down in no time.  The best way to
           do it is have 3 characters attack (Ultima works good) and the 4th
           one heal.
   Final Fight Lvl 2   (approximate values for hps) 
		Left   HP: 40000    MP: ????    Weakness: ????
		Middle HP: 24000    MP: ????    Weakness: ????
   	      TopRight HP: 27000    MP: ????    Weakness: ????
	      BotRight HP: 30000    MP: ????    Weakness: ????
		VANISH/DOOM: no
           There are 4 things to attack here.  The same strategy as above 
           should work.
   Final Fight Lvl 3   (approximate values for hps)
		Left   HP: 10000    MP: ????    Weakness: ????
		Right  HP: 40000    MP: ????    Weakness: ????
		VANISH/DOOM: no
           Only two things to attack here.  If you're using attacks that
           only hit a single target, concentrate them on the angel head
           (the one on the left) because it'll heal both targets.  When you
           get the right target down low it'll get mad and start using major
           damage attacks like Merton.  Have your Cure spells ready.
   Kefka: The End      HP: 62000 (approx.)  MP: ????    Weakness: ????
		VANISH/DOOM: no
           Be ready to cure when he uses Fallen One (which reduces all your
           characters to 1 hp).  Even regular/special attacks work pretty
           good on him (that's all I used and the fight went pretty quick).
           Make this fight go even quicker by using the Quick spell.
	   Another tactic that makes the fight go quicker is to equip everyone
	   with Flame Shlds and use Merton.

   Once you have the airship you can go anywhere on the map.  You can land
   anywhere except for mountains, forests, and deserts.  Inside the airship
   you can change you party members by talking to any of the characters on the
   ship.  Also on the ship you will find three non-playable characters: one
   will restore your hps and mps, one will sell you stuff (Item shop), and the
   third one will allow you to unequip some or all of your characters.  The
   restorer and the Item shop aren't on the second airship that you get in the

   Any time you have Shadow in your party (in either the World of Balance or
   the World of Ruin) you can visit an Inn and possibly
   learn more about Shadow's past.  To do so all you have to do is sleep at
   an Inn (in any town) or any other place you can sleep (like the beds in
   Doma Castle) and the hope you get a dream sequence.  The odds of getting
   a dream sequence are like 1:4 for the first four sequences and 1:32 for 
   the 5th one.  [There may be more].

	When a character gets low on hps (they kneel down in battle) there
	is a possibility that they will do a special attack that does 
	massive damage.  The attacks are done by using the FIGHT command
	while hps are low (and then only at random).  The attacks are:
CHARACTER:	NAME OF ATTACK:		DESCRIPTION OF ATTACK:
Terra		Riot Blade		Throws rings at enemies
Locke		Mirager			Quickly dashes in for the kill
Edgar		Royal Shook		Flash of light
Sabin		Tiger Break		Drop kick
Celes		Spin Edge		Chainsaw-like attack with sword
Shadow		Shadow Fang		Hops on and slashes the enemy
Cyan		Back Blade		Screen goes black while he attacks
Setzer		Red Card		Throws 3 sets of cards in a row
Mog 		Moogle Rush		Looks like Pummel
Strago		Sabre Soul		Flash of light as he jumps at enemy
Relm		Star Prism		Stars surround enemy
Gogo		X-Meteor		A giant meteor strikes enemy

NOTE: Gau and Umaro don't have a near death attack because they don't have
	a FIGHT command.

	-Equip both the Offering and the Genji Glove and your characher will
	 attack 8 times, 4 with each hand.
	
	-Similar to the above, you can equip the Offering and the ThiefGlove
	 to Locke and then when he uses the CAPTURE command he'll attempt to
	 steal 4 times.

	-You can have Locke steal from the creatures on the Solitary Island.
	 Of course you have to do it before they self destruct.  The Peepers
	 have Elixirs and the EarthGuards have Megalixirs

        -You can have Locke still from the Aquilas in the Phoenix cave
	 and you may get an Economizer.

       ?-In the forest shaped like a dragon's head to the north of the Veldt
	 you may run into Brachosaur.  They supposedly leave Econimizers once
	 in a while when you beat them. This forest is also a good spot to
	 raise levels (especially with the experience egg).

        -Intangirs and Flans have Magicite that Locke can steal.

	-Equip Umaro with the Gauntlet relic to raise both his Bat.Pwr and
	 his Defense.
	
	-Once Locke has the Theif Glove have him attempt to Capture from
	 everything.  Lots of times he'll just steal stuff like Tonics and
	 Potions, but other times he'll steal stuff like Elixirs, Magicites,
	 and Relics.
	
	-Any undead monster can be killed instantly with a Revivify, a Fenix
	 Down or a Life spell.
	
	-Cast DOOM on a party member wearing the Relic Ring to heal that 
	 member's HPS to their MAX.

	-You can defrost a frozen party member with a FIRE spell.

	-Having a different lead character when using a tent will change the
	 tent's color and the banner or symbol on the center pole.
		Umaro & Mog 	      - White tent with star on top
		Setzer,Shadow, & Cyan - light blue tent with a cross (or
							 something) on top
		Celes,Sabin, & Edgar  - green tent with crown on top
		Terra 		      - purple tent with bow on top
		Locke                 - orange tent with boomerang (or moon)
							on top
		Gau,Gogo,Strago, & Relm - orange tent with star-like 
							thing on top

	-Cast Vanish on an enemy and then cast either X-Zone or Doom on that
	 enemy for an instant defeat (this even works on some of the bosses).

	-Equip both the Ragnarok esper and the Paladin Shld to learn Ultima
	 twice as fast as normal (Ultima * 2).

	-Use relics that normally prevent a status ailment to cure them.
	 (i.e. equip an Amulet which prevent poison to cure a poisoned
	 party member).
 
	-Equip the Cure Ring to counteract the effects of the Thornlet.

	-Equip the Ribbon to counteract the effects of the Cursed Shld.

	These are things that I've heard about.  Can anyone confirm any 
	of these.

	- A ressurection potion may exist on an island near Gau's father's
	  house.  This potion is supposed to be able to bring General Leo
	  back to life.  I've heard you get it from some sort of dragon.
		[I think this one's pretty much been proven wrong]

	- If you get all the Espers (this includes transforming Odin into
	  Raiden), have all the characters, keep Cid alive,
	  and have all the Paladin equipment, then supposedly you'll get a
	  secret ending.

	- Equip the Cursed Ring for 255 battles and it may turn into the
	  Paladin Ring.  You can get Cursed Rings by betting the cursed shield
	  in the Colesseum or by using Ragnarok on the monster Veteran.

NOTE: With the experience code you can put it in and get Terra up to 99 at 
      the beginning of the game and then save it.  After that you don't need to
      use that code any more because everyone will be lvl 99 when you get them 
      (except Banon, i think he was only 96).  Also if you use this code both 
      Terra and Celes will have all sorts of spells (Ultima, Pearl, Flare, 
      Meteor, etc). You're practically invincible :)
NOTE: The codes that give Terra new commands do not work on saved games.  You
      have to use them on new games, but once you have them they CAN be saved.
      The SHOCK command is just what General Leo uses in Thamasa when he fights
      Kefka.  The SUMMON command is used to call on the equipped Esper and
      can be used as many times as you have mps for in one battle.  The POSSESS
      command is what the Ghosts in the Phanton Train have.  The HEALTH command
      is like what Banon has.  MAGITEK is like what you have when you're wearing
      MagiTek armor.  And the rest of the commands are like what your normal
      characters have.
