     This file contains notes and things "not quite in" the FAQ yet.
Reasons of time constraints, "dunno where to put it", between updates,
etc...  This file is subject to updates/changes/additions without
notice (read: I won't post this if it's changed) but you can find
the most current file at the usual ftp sites (netcom, and apparently
now "Geese's" site too.)  Also, these are more or less my "notes",
so don't whine if you don't understand what something means. =^)
